Bruce took away </span><span>from priesthood</span><span>&nbsp;meeting that it is important that we </span><span class="c6">be</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;like Jesus (as opposed to what we might say or do). As we were leaving to go to church, Jessica took our picture.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 442.13px; height: 589.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 442.13px; height: 589.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the evening we attended a stake missionary fireside. We prayed with Sister Anderson who was having a hard time with her new senior companion. Then we drove towards Kailua to pick up food, but the selected place was closed, so we turned around at a military cemetery and picked up food at Golden Pho.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Monday we drove the borrowed truck </span><span>to district</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;council and waited around until the new district leader arrived with the keys. We gave away a lot of things and brought the rest back (down one box). Drove into Honolulu and got about the worst possible outcome. We came home and found food. Picked up the Scion (paid $97.13 to repair the emergency brake). We spoke with Jasmin about brakes in general. We returned the borrowed truck, moving the parking tag to Scion. Jessica and Sara shopped for curtains for the apartment.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday morning, we received some bad news. We went to the apartment of a member who needs to move out, and helped them move and clean for a couple of hours; very hot and sweaty work! Made an appointment for 7:30 am in Honolulu. Rested, then went to eat at Haleiwa Joe&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 305.50px; height: 229.13px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 305.50px; height: 229.13px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 304.82px; height: 228.14px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 304.82px; height: 228.14px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Afterwards, Sara and Jessica did some more shopping, and Bruce hung new curtains..</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday, Sara and Jessica drove to Honolulu for an appointment. Then she flew to SLC leaving at 11am and getting in just after midnight, Utah time. Sara got lost, even though she had a phone showing her a route (but not talking to her) because it seems it took her most of the way home and then had her make a u-turn and brought her back into the Honolulu area. She called me, and I brought up a map on the laptop and coached her. I walked out to the street and she picked me up and we drove to Pan&#39;s Kitchen for breakfast. Ran into Jasmin there. Rested, made phone calls, starting to clean and organize the place before inspection tomorrow at 3:30pm. Back in Orangeville, Mike Perry is taking good care of everything. Here we show that he is now part of the ward there:</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 194.50px; height: 155.99px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 194.50px; height: 155.99px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today he drove over to Castle Dale and deposited Bruce&#39;s retirement check from Canada (in Canadian dollars, so that&#39;s always interesting). He also helped us yesterday evening, to track down some infrequently-used documents that we left behind and suddenly needed, and sent us a scan. Call from sisters having A/C problems; we&#39;ll check on them tomorrow at 1pm.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday morning, we got up early and spent a couple of hours finishing the cleaning of the newly vacated member apartment. As we were leaving, some repairmen arrived to fix a hole in the drywall; we&#39;ll return for the final cleaning after they are done. Mission-wide zoom call at 10am. Lunch at Big City Diner, using a generous gift card from the Mundells. Drove to sisters apartment with an extension cord for their A/C, and windshield washer fluid. Shopped for groceries at Safeway. Met with Kyle from property management to arrange for some repairs for our apartment. Text messages with Mike to manage the latest mail.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday morning, we left for final cleaning at 6am and were done at 7:20am. Carried everything up from the car and Sara mopped our bits of linoleum. Rested. Calls from Tiffany and Mike. Asked for a parking permit until next Thursday, and Aaron delivered it. Sara baked a loaf of sourdough bread.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday, we awoke and made some phone calls. We took our extra box fan (that Bruce found for free near the trash and Sara cleaned thoroughly) to the sisters with A/C problems at noon. Met with a repairman at their place, who said it was planned to put their A/C on its own circuit. Visit from the other sisters who were picking up twelve Books of Mormon from our supply. The Mundells had explained to us that when we get down to one case, we need to have Sister Lelegren order three cases for us. We also provide a bookmark listing a number of chapters and verses which we will have highlighted.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
