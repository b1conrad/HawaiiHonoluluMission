We got to church on time </span><span>for sacrament</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;meeting. Two brand new deacons passed the sacrament, each shadowed by an experienced deacon, which was cool. The Sunday school lesson, on the creation, by Scott was &nbsp;interesting. Home for naps. Back for Syah&#39;s baptism at 5pm. We met the Richters (from Kaneohe first ward) and had an interesting conversation with them, over a dinner provided by the ward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 313.00px; height: 200.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 313.00px; height: 200.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Before the baptism: Elder Phister (who baptized), Syah, and Elder Kam (who confirmed).</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Monday, we got up and helped three sets of elders wash their three cars, at 9:30am. Then we drove north looking for Bathtub Beach, but didn&#39;t locate it, and visited Pounders Beach instead. Then, on the way home we stopped at a lovely fruit stand located on a five acre farm, which was a lot of fun; we bought a coconut, two passion fruit, and a cup of sugar cane juice &mdash; delicious. We got home just in time to help Sisters Paez and Sorensen wash their car. Mike Perry </span><span>found a proof</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of insurance that we needed so that we could get a safety inspection for the truck, and emailed us a scan which Bruce printed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Tuesday morning we are getting ready to go </span><span>to district</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;council meeting, with two pieces of mail for the other sisters. At the meeting, we sang happy birthday to Sisters Krupp and Sorensen who had had birthdays during the past week. When we arrived home, there were packages on our porch for Elders Fehoko and Olson, and a perishable fruit bouquet for Sister Krupp, along with a random small vase with flowers and no designated recipient. Bruce rushed these back to the chapel, getting there just in time to deliver them. He and Sister Krupp agreed to give the unnamed flowers to Sister Sorensen. After lunch, we drove over to see Cary to give him some BF&amp;C for his wounds and had a long talk with him. We got home in time for a short nap and then cut up fruit for a salad to take to a meal with DLB and the Chuns, and had a great time, getting home well after dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday, as we were starting out to take the truck in to get inspected, Bruce received a telephone call from Matt Greene &quot;confirming that the Marriott School has approved the Fin 300 course you requested to substitute for MSB 250/Fin 201 in the BGS Business emphasis.&quot; This is exceedingly good news, and negates (by contradicting) the &quot;bad news (re finance)&quot; we received last Friday, after we had fasted and prayed the weekend of the 11th. Matt said that moments after that phone call was finished last Friday, the person from the School of Business just happened to be walking past his office door (which&hellip; never happens (the two buildings are a twenty minute walk apart)) and he went out and talked with her, after which she indicated that they would reconsider the question. He told Bruce that he didn&#39;t want to call us right back to tell us that, in case it didn&#39;t work out. So today, as soon as he learned, he called! Sara drove the truck to the garage, and Bruce followed in the Scion, so excited to share the good news with her upon his arrival there. The garage could not accept the proof of insurance that Mike had texted to us, but fortunately, Helaman had arranged for a temporary card to be mailed and it had arrived yesterday, and Bruce had thought to bring it along. Whew.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the truck was ready, we drove in the Scion to pick it up, and after Sara parked the truck in a visitor spot (with a proper tag), we drove to the library in Kailua. Bruce dropped her off at the Kalama beach parking lot and went on to the library to return his books and get some more. Just as he was pulling out of that parking lot, Sara texted &quot;Done&quot;, and it was great to get together again. Sara was taking pictures of a flower when we met on the path. She reported that the beach was too shallow for her to get in as deep as she would have liked and the waves were too strong for her to stay as long as she would have liked.</span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 596.50px; height: 334.28px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 596.50px; height: 334.28px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Clockwise from flower, wild bird (chickens run wild), the beach itself, and the walkway thereto.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday is another nice cool day, as we prepare for SYS video conference and Bruce prepares for the lesson he is to lead discussion for this coming Sunday. Long talk with Helaman. Drove to chapel because we thought we had meetings but that&#39;s next week. Went shopping, after dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday we&#39;ll be getting ready for a senior couple get-together (held monhtly on the fourth Friday) for the couples stationed on Oahu. We will bring dessert (which we purchased when shopping last night). We drove to the stake center to see if we could get keys to the building (no), and to see if we could get Sara signed up to take a class from pathways (maybe, with some phone help from South Africa (where is was midnight); we&#39;ll keep working on that). Home to lunch, to watch a show, and to bathe and nap. Drove to and from the senior couple party at the institute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 240.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 240.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Once again Sara in &frac14; profile at the lower right (and Bruce behind the camera).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday morning, Bruce went for half an hour to help clean the chapel, at 7:30am. He also met with the elders to deliver a package and some Books of Mormon and help with a phone problem. It was also a laundry day.</span></p></body></html>
