Odd to be chilled here. In the morning, Daniel texted us &quot;Gonna have to cancel today. Gotta pick up my son in Hauula and meet with a job interview&hellip; Sorry.&quot; Sara expressed disappointment and encouraged him to &quot;come for just an hour at 11 am?&quot; Just before we needed to leave for our </span><span>ward&#39;s</span><span>&nbsp;fast and testimony meeting, he texted &quot;Actually just picked up Michael </span><span>and job</span><span>&nbsp;interview changed to 1pm. I&#39;ll be there. Praise God.&quot; That made us happy! We truly enjoyed taking the sacrament and then the testimonies in our own ward meeting. At the conclusion of the meeting, the ward stood and sang </span><span class="c5">Aloha &#39;Oe</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to the young missionary leaving on his mission, as ward members filed by to embrace him and give leis and other gifts. So very moving! We rushed to our car and drove to Aiea and got to their meetinghouse with minutes to spare. Elder and Sister Andersen met us and introduced us to the three elders. It was a great meeting, and Daniel felt the spirit. We drove home, and ate lunch at 1pm. Naps followed, and we had a quiet evening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday morning, Sara made a beautiful breakfast (as she always does, but it usually escapes notice) with bacon, eggs, tomato, and &mdash; star of the show &mdash; hash browns perfectly made from leftover baked potatoes. Meanwhile, Bruce was on the phone with DMBA for one hour and twenty-three minutes (much of it on hold) to deal with a collection letter from an agency acting on behalf of Quest Diagnostics. Fraud! They are attempting to collect, from the patient, the amount of discount they contractually are bound to accept from the insurance company. Now, he just needs to write a scathing letter to get this new (second attempt with a different one) collection agency to give up. Plus do all of the other things on his list today, including sending the Church our monthly rent/utilities contribution. Got everything paid and mailed. A mirror was delivered to our door and we took it to the sisters. While out shopping we received a great call from Daniel. He needs a Book of Mormon with larger print. We asked mission headquarters, who have the large print edition back-ordered. Naps after lunch. Daniel called again, and Sara suggested he listen to a conference talk by David P. Homer, &quot;Trusting Our Father&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Tuesday had another great breakfast after scripture study. Bruce got a text message from Phil about a piece he has written, about Manifold. We arrived just on time </span><span>for District</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Council. The meeting had a great spirit. Sara spoke with Daniel on the phone for part of the time. We stopped at a new (to us) grocery store (Times) on the way home. Skip-Bo and naps. Daniel called with good news for his career, and promised to meet with the elders. We spoke with DLB about his dinner invitation for tomorrow night at 6:30pm. We are to bring gluten-free pasta and a green salad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Wednesday morning, we enjoyed sleeping in for just a short while. We had been awakened just after midnight by the blaring of our combined smoke/CO monitor, signalling smoke. The good news is that it fulfilled its function of pulling us out of our dreams to full alert, and that there was neither smoke nor fire. So, it was a false alarm. The bad news is that waving it around didn&#39;t stop it, and so we had to disable it. Bruce managed to scrape a knuckle in the process (sigh; it&#39;s a gift &mdash; scraping a knuckle in the oddest ways is one of his super powers). The mission housing coordinators have shipped us a new one. Hopefully, fingers crossed, it won&#39;t be </span><span>wont to</span><span>&nbsp;false </span><span>alarms</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;like its two predecessors. </span></p><p class="c8"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 453.91px; height: 400.81px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 453.91px; height: 400.81px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sadly, we learned today of the assasination in Orem, Utah (our long-time home town) of Charlie Kirk. We&#39;re a little bit overwhelmed that this is happening. Bruce wonders if we have learned nothing from the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1757876199370334&amp;usg=AOvVaw27REKSR81miK8-qUMknbTp">100 years of solitude</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in Colombia? We&#39;re trying to move on, because we are expected to be apolitical while on our mission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We spent quite a bit of time texting several people to find out when our ward is going to be cleaning at the temple. We had notified both the Elders&#39; Quorum president and our Bishop that we are willing to join that effort if needed. We learned just now that it will be this very evening at 5pm. That conflicts unfortunately with our dinner engagement tonight. We enjoyed our dinner, and shopped at Safeway on the way home. One of our later nights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Thursday (9/11) and SYS was inspiring today, with the president reminding us to be peacekeepers. &quot;By this shall men know ye are my disciples&quot; &mdash; meaning </span><span class="c5">not</span><span>&nbsp;by our name tags with his name &mdash; because &quot;ye have love one for another.&quot; He challenged us to treat our companions well. Also, due to the fifth Sunday lesson, taught across our mission, there was a spike in member referrals. Leaving now to shop at Costco in Waipio. Horrible experience at checkout. We don&#39;t know how to describe it, except &quot;</span><span class="c2"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dog_in_the_Manger&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1757876199371551&amp;usg=AOvVaw2130fzGZO8nXKQn4XbUcXv">dog in the manger</a></span><span class="c1">&quot;. They have treated us badly three out of four times we have gone there, which is sad because it is much easier to get to than the store in Honolulu, and not nearly as crowded. Oh, well. Delivered a set of groceries to one pair of sisters and the others will be coming at 6pm to pick up theirs. Naps and Skip-Bo. We are still a little rattled by rhetoric giving way to violence and murder yesterday, not to mention the anniversary of the much larger violence and murder twenty-four years ago today. Ironically, the young missionaries weren&#39;t born yet then, and so only know of this via the last day of their American History class in High School. Sara made the most delicious stuffed bell peppers for dinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday started out well. Then, while preparing a salad for lunch, Sara cut her finger badly. After first aid she was sick to her stomach and over-heated, so took a bath. Our new smoke/CO detector arrived in the mail. The manual that comes with it is pretty intense and very long. Bruce gave it an initial read and set it aside for now. We enjoyed the delicious soup Sara prepared a few days ago. Bruce wanted to share this candid picture of the main room in our apartment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The laundry area is behind the photographer; the kitchen is partially visible to the right; there is one bedroom/bathroom off to the right (through the bluish open doorway) and another to the left through the white double doors. The main area is about 16 by 22 feet; bedrooms about the same. (The shot is actually from August 31, but Bruce felt like including it this week. It is neater now!)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday we awoke early, about 4am, worried about Jessica, from whom we haven&#39;t heard since Monday, and she isn&#39;t returning our calls. We&#39;re on the phone with Eli who is driving up to her house to knock on the door. A roommate at the house says it looked like she went camping with Chase and Bae a few days ago. And, we just heard from her; she is fine. Another false alarm, that only cost us a little sleep. We went over our calendar for the coming week. We heard from Elizabeth, who has been selected as one of ten people who will be singing in a community spotlight concert at the end of this month, wherein she will have a solo. We were not feeling well, and not up to socializing, so we skipped the ward supper (which had been scheduled for 6:30pm) and went to bed early.</span></p></body></html>
