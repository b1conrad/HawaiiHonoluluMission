Sara decided that she had hives and sent Bruce to the drugstore for Benadryl (of which he bought the generic form), and that helped. Enough so that after we slept in until 8:10am and Bruce started getting ready, she decided to come along. We met Daniel at the Hawaii Kai ward, and the sisters had reserved a seat for him. There was room on the other side of him, so that&#39;s where we sat. It was the homecoming for Sister Fong, and a very good service, with talks by her brother, a Sister Fisher, and then her as the concluding speaker. Daniel loved it, and then had to leave to pick up his kids, so Bruce walked out to his car with him. We stopped at Safeway for lunch on the way back, and will now (1:23pm) nap/rest. Phone calls with Ammon and Jessica. Bruce started up our dehumidifier during the evening; we were awake again at 1:11am and noticed that the water bin was full and so he emptied it. Sara had noticed on Facebook that our friend Erlene Lewis had passed away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday we drove to Honolulu for an important meeting there at 8:30am. It went well. Bruce drove to recycle, to the library, and to purchase a pillow for Elder Kam.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday morning, Bruce got up before sunrise to appreciate the 71&deg; weather and beautiful sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 454.12px; height: 405.47px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 454.12px; height: 405.47px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We picked up the two elders who use bicycles at 9:20am, bringing them a pair of pillows and a fan in a box, which Elder Crosbie took upstairs. We went to the Waikalua chapel, where they prepared for the district council meeting, which went well. Then we ran some errands and came home so that Sara could pack a suitcase. Just after 3pm, Bruce drove her to the airport. Her plane to Phoenix won&#39;t leave until 9pm, but as she texted to her children, &quot;Bruce has a hard time judging distances in the dark and I wanted him SAFE!!!!!&quot; He stopped at MacDonalds on the way home and ran into a friend of the Matavale family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday morning was cool again, at 69&deg;. When he woke up, Bruce texted Sara and Daniel, and then they had a phone call to answer a question he had while reading the testimony of the three witnesses. Helaman fixed a nice meal of tilapia, rice, and vegetables.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday dawned cool and clear at 71&deg; with no wind. Bruce has shopping ahead of him for the interview lunch. He also picked up some medication and did some banking; waiting in line, he had a nice conversation with Hank, who grew up in Idaho (grandson of Presbyterian minister) and returned to his heritage here. Bruce joined the zoom meeting a little late (got distracted). The lunch went fine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday, we talked on the phone about Sara&#39;s return, possibly tomorrow morning. Bruce went to the library to get more books to read. He and Helaman had a long talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday, we received packages for Sisters Krupp and Pugh and for Elder Crosbie. Bruce delivered them. The first one required going on a long detour around a parade this morning. Sara is still in Phoenix.</span></p></body></html>
