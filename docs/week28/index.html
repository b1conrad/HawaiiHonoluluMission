Daniel joined us there. It was one of those rare meetings where people come up and say what is their favorite hymn and why and then the congregation sings the hymn. It was very moving. Then we drove a check to the landlord, and came home via Costco, since we needed milk and eggs for the new fridge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday we drove to the beach at Kualoa, stopping at the elders&#39; apartment to check out the report we&#39;d received of a broken mattress. It has indeed broken down, and a replacement has been ordered (to arrive at our house next Sunday).</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 605.04px; height: 464.57px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 605.04px; height: 464.57px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bruce has this thing with Jessica where he takes a picture of a clock at 9:11 and texts her (in this case, &quot;Thinking of you on the way to the beach at 9:11&quot;). The origin of this is that she once tended to frequently notice the clock at that particular time and made a note of it, so now it is a thing. Yeah, we probably should check on all those warning lights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>We drove to the stake center so that Sara could do some homework, but then ended up chatting for two hours with the people there. After they left (locking us in) she worked for an hour. The truck had a notice of </span><span class="c5">checking for abandonment</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;so we washed the chalk mark off of the tire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Tuesday we enjoyed sleeping in. Nevertheless, we arrived </span><span>at district</span><span>&nbsp;council on time, only to find the gates locked. Bruce checked the messenger app, and found that at 9:21, it had been decided to hold the meeting in the stake center instead, so that&#39;s where we drove next. We were the second last companionship to arrive, and the meeting was good. Especially well done was the training by Sisters Paez and Sorensen on the </span><span class="c5">armor of God</span><span class="c1">, with illustrations prepared by the latter. Sara had the insight that the sword and shield were the parts that had to be moved about and we shared that during the role play. After the meeting, we drove to Ross and bought mugs for those same sisters and delivered them. That made them happy. Then, we came home, and while Sara rested, Bruce went out to deliver a package that came for Elder Kam.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 329.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 329.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Bruce enjoyed </span><span>the visual puns: mug</span><span>&nbsp;shot of mugs and the phone echoing the </span><span class="c5">delivered</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;status. On the way home he picked up tacos at Jack in the Box and read on the deck, as Sara rested further. The weekly puzzles came and Sara finished the sudoku well before Bruce, and he gave up on the crossword puzzle as too hard to be fun anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Wednesday promises to be a busy day, as we need to prepare part of the lunch </span><span>for zone</span><span>&nbsp;conference tomorrow (in spite of it being a holiday, New Years Day, it will be life as usual). The sisters asked us to print a game board for a lesson later today. Helaman drove to Kapolei to pay child support, and Bruce moved our car into the primo parking spot because we&#39;ll need the truck to deliver a new mattress on Sunday (when it is supposed to arrive). We went shopping at Safeway for the things needed to make lunch </span><span>for zone</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;conference, and returned home where Sara prepared a big salad and two tubs of potato casserole, while conversing at length with Helaman. Quite a few fireworks are going off around us, even as early as eight as we go to bed. </span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 403.50px; height: 215.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 403.50px; height: 215.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Just two of the Happy New Year wishes we received in the days before and after the actual event. We were notified that Bruce&#39;s sister, Colleen, and her husband LeRon Torrie arrived safely in Cebu for their mission, where it is already early afternoon on the first of January.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday was New Year&#39;s Day. It was also our zone conference, and we were up early preparing food and driving it to the stake center, and setting it out on the serving table and so forth. We provided funeral potatoes and salad, and the Petersons brought ham and corn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 348.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 348.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We&#39;re at the lower right; Elder Baumgartner (Lehi, UT), whom we ran into at the MTC upper left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday we took care of the leftovers as Sara made delicious bean and ham stew, broccoli chicken casserole, and a chicken and vegetable soup, with Bruce acting as sous-chef.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday we worked on separate projects, Sara on her finance course, and Bruce with picos.</span></p></body></html>
