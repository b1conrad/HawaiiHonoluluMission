Bruce went to the Kaneohe First Ward, hoping to greet Cary who had said he would come to church, but didn&#39;t. Then he drove to the fourth ward and enjoyed both services. He delivered to Elder Cannon a card which had come in the mail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday, Bruce got up before dawn and enjoyed some time outside, and a nice long phone call from Sara. Made out the rent check. Going to pick up the elders on bicycles, needing to leave at 9:15am. Great district council meeting; drove the elders back home afterwards. Bought some stamps to mail the rent check, and came home for lunch and nap. Packages arrived for Elder Cannon, and for Sister Pugh, along with cards for them and one for Sister Sorensen so Bruce delivered all of those. Cards for Elder Olson and Sister Haycock he will deliver tomorrow. Helaman used his rapid rewards to buy Sara a ticket back here on Sunday.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday morning, Bruce got up and sat on the porch to enjoy the sunrise. He arrived at the temple at 8:45am and took this picture after the 9:30am session.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 623.32px; height: 321.26px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 623.32px; height: 321.26px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Sister Peterson&#39;s sister&#39;s husband took a picture of most of the zone. Afterwards, while driving out of the parking lot, Bruce handed a card to Elder Olson through the passenger window, then drove down to the visitor center.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he walked in the door he texted Sister Haycock that he had her piece of mail with him in the visitor center; who should walk in just before he hit send? Her and her companion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 441.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 441.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Front: Sisters Peterson, Taumoefolau, Twyman, Sorensen, Pugh, Krupp, and Haycock. Back: Elders Jimenez, Peterson, Conrad, Strickland, Kam, Olson, Hess, Hirschi, Fowler, Cannon, Tesoro, and Crosbie. Missing: Sisters Conrad, Larson, Workman, and Anderson; Elder Larson.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bruce stopped at MacDonalds in Laie to take a phone call with Sara and Ben, then drove as far as Ka&#39;a&#39;awa to purchase 8.55 gallons of gas, then stopped for lunch finally (at about 1pm (having had no breakfast)) at Keneke&#39;s Grill at Punalu&#39;u (see also week 16). Helaman fixed a nice tilapia-based supper. Calls from Sara and Daniel; the latter has set December 16th as his baptismal date.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday, once again Helaman prepared a great breakfast of scrambled eggs, bacon, and a croissant. Bruce had been thinking about getting an egg mcmuffin, so that really hit the spot. After eating, he did some shopping where he ran into a member and suggested she introduce herself to our friend who works at Safeway. After that, he delivered a letter for Sister Haycock by pinching it into their locked gate. On the way home, he drove to Kaneohe Beach Park, where he took the next pictures (below the fold). In the distance, you can just make out the distinctive peaks above Kualoa Regional Park, closer views of which are in pictures &mdash; taken from the stake center, and even closer ones taken from within the park itself &mdash; in earlier episodes of this blog.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 482.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 482.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday, looks like rain. Sitting on the front porch until sunrise, which wasn&#39;t visible except as an overall lightening of the overcast sky. Phone calls from Elizabeth and from Sara. The SYS zoom call was inspiring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Packages arrived for Elders Olson and Tesoro and he sent them text messages. Waiting for steaks that Elder Cannon is expecting to arrive in a cooler. They arrived and he took the very large package to the stake center and put it in the fridge. While at the stake center, Bruce attended the ward&#39;s Book of Mormon bi-monthly study group. The elders acknowledged the text message and the other elders came by the apartment to pick up their packages, so, delivery&hellip; done.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday, Bruce lingered longer in bed, but got up and bought breakfast before ten. The library opens today at eleven, so he&#39;ll go out again to return some books and do some recycling. More packages arrived and Bruce sent out text messages to the recipients. In the evening, Bruce walked around the property (with a group of people, most of whom he didn&#39;t know) to look at the twenty or so units which had Christmas decorations. Nice fourty-five minute walk at 73&deg; (while the weather app on his phone showed 35&deg; in Orangeville).</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Saturday morning was mostly clear (although rain is forecast for the first four days of next week), and exceedingly windy. Bruce sat on the deck to watch the sunrise, scheduled for 7am. Beautiful day (</span><span class="c5">goes</span><span>&nbsp;could have gone without saying). At 7:40am, he checked in for Sara&#39;s return flight tomorrow. Jasmin called at about 11:12am to say he was done at the dentist and we agreed to meet at Don </span><span>Goyos</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at 11:45, which we did. Bruce liked the single tamale meal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 457.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 457.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>After eating we went to O&#39;Reilly auto parts to buy the brake pads ($64) and drove to Jasmin&#39;s house. There he installed our new-to-us instrument cluster and changed the front brake pads; meanwhile Bruce talked with his neighbor, who offered him some fruit and soda and showed him through his backyard which has eight small ponds fed by the stream behind (and drained </span><span>into same</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at the lower end). Small world: his wife &mdash; who is currently enjoying Christmas in Germany &mdash; was born in Alberta. It is so nice to have a working speedometer, and updated brakes ($300 labor). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At home before dark and a nice long conversation with Helaman. Awake at 3:42am helping Sara find the right terminal and gate, then back to sleep. But first, he checked out the transfers (he missed the transfer zoom call at 9pm (by forgetting about it)) and we&#39;re going to lose six of the twelve missionaries in our district this coming Thursday; this realization initiated a long texting thread with Sara. Sad, but at least she&#39;ll be back to say goodbyes next Tuesday.</span></p></body></html>
