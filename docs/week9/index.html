There was a great spirit in the sacrament meeting. Two different members gave us a white shirt, for Danny since Bruce had asked during Sunday School a couple of weeks ago. We suspect one will be too small and the other too large, but we&#39;ll see. Sunday school class was great, with the teacher, Dennis, making a valiant effort to express the ineffable, all while managing to communicate just how marvelous our destiny is, as he presented D&amp;C 88. After lunch, we met two grandchildren and their mother in a park near Kailua at 2:30pm.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Monday is the day our original mission call had set for us to enter the MTC in Provo. We have had so many wonderful and miraculous experiences since our arrival here on June 30, that it&#39;s hard to imagine what life might have been like, but for the miracles described in our &quot;</span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bruceatbyu.com/s/HHMweek0&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1756015388383065&amp;usg=AOvVaw2lbOd4G14S4IASXO7eBzcb">week zero</a></span><span class="c1">&quot; post. Also on Monday, we drove into Honolulu for a very important meeting at 10:30am. It wasn&#39;t the best possible outcome, but a big step in the right direction. Home hungry for lunch and naps. Laundry; we only have four or five outfits so laundry happens often, a couple of times a week, since we are fortunate to have a washer and dryer right by the kitchen.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Tuesday morning, we enjoyed sleeping in just a little bit before fixing breakfast. We checked the status of our package from Gourmia and found that it arrived this morning, two days earlier than promised, to our post office box in Orangeville. Bruce phoned the post office to see if they could forward it to us in Hawaii. No, they cannot. Nor can they take instructions over the phone to accept payment to post it here. Mike will take care of it when he can. We attended our district council meeting, which was good, as usual. Then, we drove into Honolulu on the off chance that it would be useful. It was, as we met a knowledgeable man, Dane, who was able to explain some things to us, which we appreciated. That meeting was a miracle of timing, as he came out to the vending machine for a snack just as we walked into the lobby, and the receptionist, Bill, started answering our questions but then, when he saw him, called Dane over, who is the </span><span>director</span><span>&nbsp;of the service we needed to understand. Great timing! Thank you, Lord. Then we drove to the Costco in Waipio and got lunch which Bruce ate at his pace while Sara shopped. She found a nice chocolate cake that we gave to Jasmin, when we got home (a tangible thank you for his help </span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bruceatbyu.com/s/HHMweek8&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1756015388384518&amp;usg=AOvVaw3oByG1ouHmzd2rV2aTghZP">last week</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;when we ran out of gas). We are hoping for some good news at 5:30pm (the same news that we hoped for at the same time yesterday (things move slowly in Hawaii)). A phone call came from Elder Ames in which he asked us to participate in the baptism service next Sunday, in Manoa, at 6:30pm. Surprise visit from the sisters, who stayed during their dinner hour and we fed them odds and ends of things. Below are Sister Mobil (Malaysia) and Sister Anderson (Colorado), each smiling while holding a chocolate muffin.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 318.96px; height: 346.96px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 318.96px; height: 346.96px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just as the sisters were leaving, the elders dropped by to pick up some tortillas we had bought for them at Costco earlier today.

So they will be missed, and we will enjoy meeting and working with the new companions of Sister Anderson and Elder Fowles.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Wednesday morning, an important meeting in Honolulu went well. Shopping today with a 40% coupon yielded significant savings. We went to inspect the elders car and apartment at 3:30pm. These hadn&#39;t been used for the last three or four weeks since one elder went home unexpectedly. We took out dinner from Don Goyo&#39;s Mexican Foods in the Windward Shopping Center. Tamales with mole sauce, rice and beans, tortilla chips and salsa. Very good. The store is operated by Jasmin&#39;s brother-in-law, so we got good treatment (complimentary chips and salsa).</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Thursday is our second transfer day, as it is the last day of our second transfer. A &quot;transfer&quot; is both a period of time, equal to six weeks, and also the day when missionary companionships change (once every six weeks). Hence, we refer to today </span><span>a transfer</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">day</span><span class="c1">. It&#39;s a fine logistical puzzle (making sure everyone has at least one companion). For example, both sets of sisters will drive in one car to Makakilo where Sister Miner will join her new companion. Then the three remaining sisters will drive to Waipahu where Sister Mobil will be dropped off with her new companion, leaving two who will drive to the airport to pick up a new companion from Maui. Finally, the three sisters will drive to Honolulu where the new companion for Sister Jones will be picked up, and all four will go to their apartments in Kaneohe. Done. Mike texted us that our package is on its way to us. Today is also a moving day for us, where we are helping a member move into a new place. Just before dark, sisters Anderson and Haycock dropped in and told their tale of woe about the transfer, in which a lot of extra driving (and waiting) happened because of some misunderstandings and wrong addresses. Sister Haycock had been the last &mdash; of a dozen or so missionaries arriving at the airport about the same time &mdash; to be picked up, and so was waiting alone for about five minutes. But it all worked out in the end. We attended the 9pm zoom meeting and enjoyed our interaction with the young missionaries.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Friday, which would have been our last day in the MTC if we hadn&rsquo;t been blessed to come earlier and assigned to such a good location for our needs. We visited the local branch of the library to find out how to borrow books, then asked Aaron for a signed document saying that we live in the community he manages. He&#39;ll get it to us next week. Wonderful dinner with black cod, salad, and cauliflower with cheese sauce, enjoyed with our son.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Saturday we are preparing to go to a baptism that will be held in the Kaneohe Stake Center, of a new convert for the Kaneohe 2nd ward. We plan to go early, so Sara can practice the piano pieces that she will accompany. One was a new hymn, on the front and back of a page, so Bruce disassembled two of the binders so she could have two copies in front of her, one for each side. The chorister didn&#39;t know it either! So, Bruce stood beside her and sang it with her while she led the small congregation. Before that, he also went to the chapel and got six other booklets and passed them around as the bishopric counsellor was welcoming everyone. The baptism went well, and Sara played while the chorister led singing of three hymns while we waited for the men to change out of their wet clothes. Bruce stood in the circle (with Elder Peterson, President Andersen, and three brethren from the ward) for the confirmation. Bruce carefully returned eight booklets (of new hymns) to the chapel. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>As the font was being filled, Bruce was reminded of that time in Mauritius when we had a challenging baptism, on </span><span class="c5"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/17nUGGip5mse5Lv4HXPXd_7oBeP5bDjRfipeq5MdZAQ0/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1756015388388920&amp;usg=AOvVaw3G8digWFjBUOmz92mMFixZ">June 7, 2014</a></span><span class="c1">.
