Ron, Melanie, and Katie Harper loaded up all of our suitcases in our car. Ron and Katie drove Bruce in their car to Myrna Layton&#39;s house in Provo. We had a great conversation and Bruce enjoyed his last trip up Price Canyon as a spectator. He and Myrna then drove in her car to Coalville for the </span><span class="c8"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://myrnalayton.blogspot.com/2025/06/end-of-month-recap.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754518574573367&amp;usg=AOvVaw2SbXZM0ekbIlLfcZQ5G77y">memorial service</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of our cousin Darlla. Sara drove our car and luggage with Melanie, stopping to see Emily and Ben Powell on the way to Eli&#39;s house. We all met up finally at the Harper&#39;s where we spent the night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Early Monday morning, we set out together to visit a bank and a doctor&#39;s office. Then we split up, with Sara helping Jessica move. Bruce visited another bank and had lunch with Thom Boyer (something he had done monthly, but not since January, and not planned again until 2027). He also visited the Office of Information Technology in the ITB and had some great conversations with former colleagues. One of these, Brent Moore, had served a young mission in Hawaii and gave some great stories and advice. We met up at Jessica&#39;s and drove to Harper&#39;s where we spent the night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Early Tuesday morning, we drove to the MTC (arriving at our assigned time of 8:42), where we checked in, to room S2-316 (just across the hall from room 317 that we had enjoyed twelve years earlier). We received via email our itinerary on Delta flight </span><span class="c3">316</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for the following Monday (a numeric coincidence that Bruce enjoyed). Usually senior missionaries enter the MTC on a Monday, but there had been a mission leader training the week before that spilled over. At 10 a.m. we met our morning teachers in T1-219. They are Sister Talbot and Brother Kidd. They gave us an overview of Preach My Gospel and we met the Muellers and the Stevenses who are also part of our district. They guided us on a tour, including this stop on a terrace of T3:</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 229.73px; height: 308.97px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 229.73px; height: 308.97px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After lunch (where we met some sisters learning French), we met with the MTC presidency. Sara gave the opening, and Bruce the closing prayer. In the afternoon class we met those teachers, Brother Brunjes and Sister Creager, for a short class. Then orientation with our branch presidency (minus the president who couldn&#39;t get off work). Dinner, then the MTC devotional where a presentation was given by Elder Nelson of the seventy and his wife. They had six young missionaries come up to play a game which showed the importance of the Holy Ghost. It was a long day, and bed was welcome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday was classes and meals. Brother Colby Brunjes said goodbye to us, as he will be attending his sister&#39;s wedding the next day. We got to know SIster Garrison, who was interested in Dr. Lund&#39;s CDs. We began preparing a lesson around that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday, at breakfast, Bruce ran into Elder Larson, from our Orangeville ward. Class was just three hours in the morning, then a delightful workshop on adjusting to missionary life, senior style. In the afternoon, in 214j, we taught Elder and Sister Waldal about the CDs (after trying unsuccessfully to get a DVD player to play them), and they taught us about the Church&#39;s addiction recovery program. Turns out he owns the CDs and they agreed to listen to a few minutes. We agreed to look up the family support meeting in Kaneohe. In the afternoon we had a safety and security presentation, and then took a group photo with McCady Creager.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 436.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 436.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday we had a small group class in the morning and met with the Waldals to discuss our follow through. We were joined by E&amp;S Bodine who had initially been assigned the Waldals. Everyone had followed through on their invitation. We learned that the Lund CDs are available online at Deseret Books digital bookshelf. We returned to our classroom for a final goodbye and picture.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sister Peterson (teacher in training), E&amp;S Mueller, E&amp;S Conrad, S&amp;E Stevens, Brother Kidd, and Sister Talbot.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On our way to lunch, we had the classic world map picture taken by Elder Hoffman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 557.63px; height: 743.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 557.63px; height: 743.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the afternoon we took a nearly three hour class on safety</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 600.58px; height: 800.44px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 600.58px; height: 800.44px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Later that evening, a card game (Phase 10) was enjoyed by (clockwise) Bruce, Sara, E&amp;S Jones, Elder Gibson, Elder Moungaloa, E&amp;S Bodine, Sister Moungaloa, and Sister Waldal, with Sister Gibson behind the camera.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 469.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 469.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sara and Bruce took Jessica and Eli and Everet to dinner at Rodizio Grill.

Sadly, Sara had not brought her drivers license so we were unable to visit Tiffany. We drove to Aunt Janis and Uncle Lynn&#39;s house to sit down while they ran an errand. Then we met them at Dee&#39;s Restaurant for brunch. In the evening we took our baggage-to-be-checked and stowed it behind the information desk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday was a branch sacrament meeting, and I was asked to bless the sacrament which was an unexpected, and moving, privilege. Other meetings ensued, along with naps, and our last night at the MTC.</span></p></body></html>
