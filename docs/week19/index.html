Bruce is preparing for the lesson </span><span>in Priesthood</span><span>&nbsp;meeting, based on Elder Rasband&#39;s talk </span><span>in General</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Conference on &quot;Right Before Our Eyes.&quot; He also published the previous week of this blog. Five minutes before the meeting started, Bruce got a phone call from John Foulkes, who was surprised to learn where we were and had called to invite us to the sealing of him and his wife, Colleen, on November 19. He received our hearty congratulations. The testimonies were inspiring, as usual in this ward, and then just before the next meeting, a text message informed Bruce that his sister, Colleen, will be going on a mission to the Cebu Philippines temple with her husband, LeRon, on December 30 for one year. Bruce&#39;s priesthood lesson went well and was well-received. After the block, we attended the missionary huddle, which was good. Home for spaghetti lunch. Back to church at 6pm for choir practice, mostly the numbers for stake conference (next rehearsal Sunday morning at 9am).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday we enjoyed the early morning, and then Bruce slept in a bit. Sara worked on her classwork and Bruce read a bit, after breakfast. We drove to the Kailua chapel for car washing but seemed to have missed it somehow; just as we were leaving, the Petersons arrived. We stopped at Whole Foods for lunch and to buy two large pizzas (which&hellip; they didn&#39;t have the toppings we wanted). We got home in plenty of time for the sisters who were quite late, so didn&#39;t start eating until 5pm. Decided to have a party on Halloween night. After they left, we drove to Waialua which was quite harrowing in the dark (should have taken highway 99). </span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 449.50px; height: 341.90px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 449.50px; height: 341.90px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We found Josie who showed us the couch for sale and we left a two hundred dollar deposit; Joey will deliver it tomorrow afternoon. We came home a different way on a much nicer road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Tuesday the alarm rang at 4:30am for seminary security. Sara had a headache and so Bruce went alone </span><span>to district</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;council; he gave a spiritual thought based on an experience from his young mission and Alma 29:9 that was well received. The meeting was good. On the way back, he returned a read library book, looked for a lost credit card, and took in some cans to recycle (receiving $1.25 for his trouble). At home, Helaman helped move our old couch, to make room for a new one to be delivered this evening. Sara made a delicious lunch of nachos. We watched a movie entitled The Girl Who Believes in Miracles. Joey delivered the couch after eight, but had forgotten to bring the cushions!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday ended up being a very long and exhausting day. Right after seminary security, we rushed into Honolulu for a doctor&#39;s appointment at 7:45am, arriving ten minutes late due to traffic on the H1. Sara started Ozempic with a nurse showing her how to use it in the office. The doctor referred Sara to an ophthalmologist who we visited the same day. We dropped some food off for Denise, and then had lunch at Betty&#39;s Burgers, and drove home, doing some shopping on the way. So, we were gone from 4:30am to 1:30pm, which is a good nine hour day. Naps ensued. Just before dark, Joey delivered the cushions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday doing laundry and some schoolwork. Getting ready for the SYS call, which was good, including hearing that our mission leaders last week had spent a few days with those from other missions and told us of Elder Bednar testifying that when a prophet is ordained he comes out a different man, even speaking more clearly and crisply. We had some long talks with Helaman and phone calls from Benjamin. Tacos for lunch, then naps. Helaman and Bruce tried Sara&#39;s autumn-themed trifles and liked them. Jessica on the phone said not to serve them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 499.00px; height: 346.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 499.00px; height: 346.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You have to understand that this one was a taste-trial. The ones Sara makes for the lunch on Saturday will have clean layers. It tasted great. Watched a movie before bedtime.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday, Bruce got up before the sunrise and watched it from the deck. Then we got into our swimming costumes and drove towards our usual beach. We stopped at the roundabout to get gas, but their pumps weren&#39;t working, so we drove all the way to Kaaawa and gassed up there. Seven gallons, but it looks like the trip meter (and the entire odometer system) doesn&#39;t measure distance correctly because we had only driven thirty-four miles since our last fillup, so that can&#39;t be right. We have ordered a new instrument cluster and hope that will fix the problem (along with giving us a reliable speedometer, which will be nice). We checked out the Swanzy beach across the street and it was great; our new favorite. On the way back, Sara took a bunch of selfies and retained this one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 415.15px; height: 551.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 415.15px; height: 551.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>She was too busy with the mechanics of taking a selfie to smile, but she was happy to have had some time in salt water. After a breakfast fruit smoothie incorporating seaweed from the beach, she made the deviled eggs and chicken broccoli casserole for tomorrow, with a little help from Bruce. For dinner we enjoyed a salad and french fried potatoes and chicken giblets. In the evening, at 5:45pm, we went to inspect an apartment in Waikane and found one </span><span>elder</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>sick</span><span>&nbsp;there; we decided to fix him </span><span>some </span><span class="c7">mate</span><span>&nbsp;and bring </span><span>it back</span><span>. First though, we ordered some pizzas, then inspected one set of sisters&#39; </span><span>apartment</span><span>, delivered a pizza to the other set, picked up hot water for the </span><span class="c7">mate</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;and drove the other pizza and the </span><span class="c7">mate</span><span>&nbsp;in a thermos out to the elders. Home again. Lots of driving in the </span><span>dark; wasn&#39;t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;much fun, but we are glad to be home again and ready for bed at 9:15pm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday, we prepared our contribution to the interview lunch for our mission leaders, which was scheduled for 11:15am. It was really good. A picture of some of the place settings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 622.22px; height: 526.88px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 622.22px; height: 526.88px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We used real plates and utensils and that was nice; it didn&#39;t take very long to wash and dry them and put them away after the meal. Then we picked up a load of boxes for a member who is moving. Our final meeting of the day will be the Saturday evening session of Stake Conference at 7pm. It was a great session on ministering, with music provided by the choir of the Tongan branch. Fabulous. Nearly ten o&#39;clock before sleeping.</span></p></body></html>
