We arrived about half an hour early and enjoyed visiting with members of both the 3rd ward who were leaving their meeting and the 4th ward who were arriving. Shortly before church started, Pippin and Ozzy rushed into the chapel shouting Grandma! We hugged them and Mady, and then went up to the stand. Sara&#39;s talk was great. So, she says, </span><span>was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Bruce&#39;s. After the sacrament meeting, we walked out to the car (which the kids loved seeing again, and Bruce explained to Ozzy that we were just borrowing it) and gave them a bag of treats and art supplies. Then they went into Primary, and we drove to Honolulu to pick up Denise and her son; we drove them to the Manoa ward offices and introduced them to Brother Anderson, who it turns out is a podiatrist and knows all of her doctors. He assured us that they will arrange for her to go to the Bishop&#39;s Storehouse on Tuesday. We plan to take them to a second hand store to purchase clothing suitable for church next Sunday. We then took them home and drove to our apartment for long-needed naps. Oh, and at Manoa, when we asked for a missionary to teach them, down came Elder Ames, the other elder of the duo who came to help us with a blessing on March 12. </span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 482.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 482.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Bruce awoke in time to suggest that we attend the baptism (shown above) in the </span><span>Keolu</span><span>&nbsp;Ward building at 5pm, which turned out to be new members for the Tongan 5th branch of our stake, taught by the sisters and performed by the elders. It was a simply beautiful service, heavenly. One of the Tongan men started singing </span><span class="c4">a capella</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and was joined by others in the congregation, magically creating the most beautiful music out of thin air. We visited with some members and the other senior missionary couples afterwards, then drove home for the night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday morning, we made appointments for tomorrow. Shortly after noon, we expect a visit from the plumber. They came and snaked out one toilet, changed its mechanism, and left us a stopper for the drain in the other tub. We figured out how to order from Taco Bell online and then drove to pick it up. Heard from Craig Nagamine not such good news, with events planned on August 11 and 18.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday morning we got up early for an appointment in Honolulu at 7:30am. Then we drove to pick up Denise at 8:55 to go to Savers to buy some Sunday clothes, then just after 10am we were at the Bishop&#39;s Storehouse to pick up a food order, which we helped her carry upstairs to her apartment, after driving her home. Then we drove to Chinatown to try to find fresh palm hearts, without success. But, we parked there and ate lunch. Then we drove to Costco and shopped for ourselves, and two sets of sister missionaries. Then back to Kaneohe to deliver both sets into the refrigerator of one set. Then home, to carry up all of our own groceries. Bruce repaired a broken fridge shelf with duct tape. Sirens sounded and we learned it was a tsunami warning. Sisters Anderson and Mobil were caught in traffic and called to ask if they could stay with us during the event. Sister Adams who had been going to bring them dinner brought it to our home. We ate together and shared stories. Trying to decide whether they stay the night or go to their apartment? Risk of their car being towed overnight, having toiletries and a change of clothes, etc. Shortly after nine, the mission president authorized everyone to return to their apartments, and we all retired.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday, Bruce got a query (at 3am!) from his sister asking if we are okay, and he (later in the morning) sent a few text messages letting family members know that we are far enough inland to be safe from tsunamis. Calls to try for an appointment early Friday morning failed; we&#39;ll have to call again on Friday for a Monday appointment, but won&#39;t know right away if that will even work for us. Elders Fowles and Peterson dropped by, but didn&#39;t stay for lunch (a great soup and salad Sara fixed). We were able to cancel an appointment, finally; after a phone runaround one helpful person took care of it for us. Trying hard to get a bank transfer to work on a cell phone, with Jessica helping while watching through facetime on another phone; will try again tomorrow. Phone conversations with Helaman and Eli.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Thursday got up and went outside to check on the paperwork in our car. Good thing, because our insurance card was only good until July 12, 2025. So, Bruce made a phone call and had the insurance company email us up-to-date cards. We&#39;ll need to do that again at the end of September. Calls and communication with multiple people on various subjects, including a commitment to teach with the sisters this evening, and attend a medical visit tomorrow. Bruce wrote a blog post about a miraculous experience he had while preparing to speak on Sunday, entitled </span><span class="c3"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://conwithoutcon.blogspot.com/2025/07/communication-without-complexity.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754850735993943&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vMeEDXOWGt1Fn3NiU4Lds">Communication without Complexity</a></span><span class="c0">. The sisters&rsquo; appointment was cancelled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday preparing to go visit a new doctor. Sadly, we thought the appointment was at 1:30 and got there almost an hour early. However, it was actually at 10:30. So, we picked up the paperwork to fill out in advance of the appointment at 3:15 next Friday. Walked to the donut shop, Leonard&#39;s Bakery, and bought six one of which Bruce tried. We gave the box to Jasmin as a thank you for helping with the car&#39;s A/C. Saw some carpet that was being removed from building 24 and asked Aaron if we could have it. He brought it up to our deck, and we put three pieces into our apartment, as throw rugs so to speak. The day was exhausting, because we have been making phone calls without results, leaving messages but never getting called back. Very frustrating. Calls from Jessica, Eli, and Helaman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday morning we helped make a teaching appointment happen in Honolulu, with Sara texting our friend on her phone and Bruce texting the elders on his phone. Once that was settled, we began organizing a meeting at the chapel, where Bruce and an elder from our ward (who will be DLB in this paragraph). It was complicated because we had to get him to come to our apartment and at the same time get someone to open the chapel for us. Bruce called Scott to get the number of the ward executive secretary, Owen, so that we could find out who has keys. Calling him he answered and offered to drive the keys to the chapel and meet us there. Meanwhile we were waiting for DLB. It turned out that Owen was in a van with his family headed to an appointment, so they called us offering to bring the keys to us, which they did. Bruce left a message with DLB to change plans and meet at the chapel. It all worked out in the end. We had a good time with Mady, Pippin, and Ozzie, during which Bruce, assisted by DLB, gave each of the grandchildren a blessing, that they are loved and will listen and learn in school this term, and be healed of afflictions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 321.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 321.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They enjoyed the chalkboard in the classroom, with each one taking a side and playing school teacher with the adults as the students.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We had to leave the chapel parking lot unlocked because there was another member in the building. We followed DLB to his beautiful home and enjoyed sharing stories and spiritual experiences with him. Bruce was struck by his telling us how much he appreciated hearing his voice since he had awakened feeling sad and kept depression at bay by listening to the tabernacle choir, and that Bruce&#39;s call had come after the third number, and that our need for his service had given him the impetus to get up and face the day. And here, Bruce had been feeling bad about bothering him on a Saturday morning! We left his home with warm hearts and a couple of beautiful mangos from his impressive yard full of plants and flowers and trees. On the way back to our apartment, we drove by the chapel to be sure the gate was locked. Lunch and naps, then off to visit a couple in a neighboring area, Ahuimanu, with the sisters. Wes had just gone down for a nap, so we visited with his wife in their cool covered area. Sara bore a powerful testimony of the Book of Mormon, and the sisters left her with a copy which she said she would take with her on her upcoming trip to the mainland.</span></p></body></html>
