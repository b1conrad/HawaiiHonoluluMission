We know this, because Bruce sent a text to Brother Roberts on March 31st, asking for an appointment with Bishop Hughes on Sunday, April 20th (once we had reserved flights home for April 17, 2025). Since that was Easter Sunday, the appointment was delayed until the following Sunday. So, on April 27, we could begin the process of applying for a mission, after the bishop interviewed us and then opened up the process. But even before that, Bruce called the mission headquarters and spoke with Sister Lelegren about senior MLS possibilities, and spoke with her again a few days later (the 29th). He made both calls because the missionary website showed an opportunity for a MLS couple that was listed as both &quot;high need&quot; and &quot;currently available&quot; so we were anxious to volunteer to fill that need. Later that day, we slept through a call from the mission leader, Sister Andersen (at ten p.m.!), but she called us again the next day (again just before ten (they were in a series of zone conferences)) and seemed not to know that there was a need and was unwilling to request us because apparently quite a few people call with similar questions. She suggested that we leave the decision in the hands of the apostles. This discouraged us, and tried our faith. We filled out our papers anyway, requesting </span><span>assignment</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;somewhere on the island of Oahu, in either the Laie or Honolulu missions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bishop Hughes recommended our application on May 4, 2025. Because our medical results got delayed for some unknown reason, we were not able to meet with President Huntington until June 1st, so there was a month of trial of faith for us to wade through. He approved our application and submitted it the next day. He texted us that it was &quot;ready for assignment&quot; on June 4th. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While awaiting assignment, we decided to drive to Canada because Bruce&#39;s sister, Colleen and her husband, LeRon Torrie, were celebrating their 50th anniversary on June 7th in Grassy Lake, Alberta on their farm. Bruce telephoned Elizabeth fairly early in the morning of May 29th to see if they had any travel plans. It turned out that her mother was driving her and Bridget down to Lehi for a family wedding and then would be driving her back up there the following Thursday, June 5th. Bruce arranged for us to drive her up there as it would be on our way, and we picked her and Bridget up at her mom&#39;s house at 11am.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We arrived in Rexburg and ate dinner there with Cody, Bridget, and Elizabeth at 6pm in The Hickory Restaurant, then spent the night in a local motel. Early on Bruce&#39;s birthday the next morning, we had breakfast with them at Denny&#39;s then went on our way, leaving without taking any pictures&mdash;just this picture of the birthday card Bridget made for him. So, readers will just have to believe that these meals actually happened as described herein.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 832.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 832.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We drove an unusual way, bypassing I-15 and Butte, straight north to Helena, Montana via Island Park, Idaho and Ennis, Montana. We crossed the border into Canada without any incident, and arrived at the Conrad farm near Taber about 5:30 p.m. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surprise! Perry and Ellisa drove down from Calgary. Someone was smart enough to insist on picture-taking right away, so we wouldn&#39;t forget. Below, those who know them will recognize Perry and Elissa Conrad beside Ellen and John Conrad. In the second picture, Bruce and Sara appear beside Ellen and John.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 232.81px; height: 311.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 232.81px; height: 311.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 342.72px; height: 257.26px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 342.72px; height: 257.26px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a long visit and a good night&#39;s sleep, we drove out to Grassy Lake to participate in the Torrie celebration. A great time was had by their many guests, with LeRon and his brother performing numerous musical numbers, including the chicken dance. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thanks to Ellen&#39;s tight lips, we were able to really surprise Colleen, who hadn&#39;t expected us. She hadn&#39;t notified her siblings so that we wouldn&#39;t feel obligated to make the long trip at our age. Bruce had read about it in an email message (on a different topic) from his niece Nancy, that mentioned the event in passing. Bruce enjoyed visiting with Claude Poitra and David Jensen whom he knew from younger days, the former having also served in B&eacute;ziers in the same mission, and the latter from high school. We met others for the first time and renewed many acquaintances.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We slept Saturday night at John and Ellen&#39;s then went to church with them in Taber. We sat with Colleen and LeRon in sacrament meeting, and Bruce enjoyed short visits before and after the meeting with Leron Litchfield, Blaine Harding, and Jerry and Gail Layton.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After church in Taber, we drove out to Grassy Lake to see Colleen and LeRon when they didn&#39;t have such a huge crowd. We ended up staying the night and leaving about 4 a.m. Monday morning. This picture taken Sunday evening unfortunately doesn&#39;t include Michael, Craig, nor Eric and his family, with whom we supped and also enjoyed visiting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 297.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 297.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We got as far as Shelby, Montanna before hunger stopped us.

We were going to go the rest of the way, but spent the night in Pocatello, and arrived in Orangeville early on Tuesday, June 10th.

We quickly set up a zoom call (Eli, Jessica, and Arlene were able to join) and opened the call&hellip; to Hawaii Honolulu! To enter the MTC on August 18, 2025. When we informed him, Bishop Hughes texted, &quot;This is glorious news!!!!!!!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>And now, we have the </span><span class="c4">actual </span><span>beginning of </span><span>week zero</span><span>! All else was prologue. Week 0 is all about how our mission came to be earlier&mdash;right </span><span class="c4">now</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in fact&mdash;and as our friend, Rick Winscot quipped, &quot;Wow! When they say &#39;hasten the work&#39; they really mean it!&quot;</span></p><h1 class="c10" id="h.3jogg9foq8ik"><span class="c9">Week 0</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sunday (June 15, 2025), Kent Wilson announced our call and MTC date (August 18) over the pulpit at the very start of sacrament meeting. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Monday morning, Bruce called the mission headquarters and talked with Elder Vogelsberg of housing, telling him that we needed to come sooner, </span><span>and did they</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>happen</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to have a vacant apartment we could rent from them until our official time. The housing coordinator ended up texting the mission president, who called us later that night and asked if we could arrive June 30th, to replace the couple in Kaneohe, who were leaving that same day. He told us he would ask the missionary department for an earlier MTC week the next morning. Bishop Hughes reacted, &quot;Well, that&#39;s exciting! Heavenly Father is definitely listening to your hearts! &#128158;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday, we had a nice zoom training call with Elder and Sister Black, to introduce us to senior missionary work. That call had been scheduled to take place many weeks before the original MTC date. We still wondered if we were actually going to go early, since we hadn&#39;t heard from our mission leaders again, but in faith, we began packing.</span></p><table><tr><td><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 207.50px; height: 449.58px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 207.50px; height: 449.58px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p></td><td><p class="c1" style="padding-left:125px"><span class="c0">Also on Tuesday, we had this interesting text conversation with our stake president (times are off by four hours because this screenshot was taken in Hawaii (Utah is four hours later)). At 10:43 in the morning, he asked if we knew any more. Then again, late in the evening, at 9:41pm. This time, Bruce suggested that we go ahead with the setting apart, on the assumption that things would work out as we expected and hoped. President Huntington agreed. Again, we were moving forward in faith.</span></p><p class="c1" style="padding-left:125px"><span class="c0">Wednesday morning at eleven we received the long-awaited phone call&mdash;directly from the missionary department&mdash;informing us that we would be starting the MTC on June 24th. Finally, this little trial of faith ended.</span></p><p class="c1" style="padding-left:125px"><span class="c0">Thursday, we were set apart by our stake presidency, with wonderful blessings promised to us.</span></p><p class="c1" style="padding-left:125px"><span class="c0">Friday, and Saturday were a flurry of activity getting everything ready.</span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c1"><span>One funny little incident happened. Sara heard from Lonna Cropper, our choir director, that she had been told to move the choir number from this coming Sunday to the next one because there were going to be four speakers, instead of just the two originally planned. Lonna called on Wednesday, June 18, at 3:45pm (just a few hours after we had informed Bishop Hughes that the hastening was official) to see if we were speaking. Aha, Sara thought, Kent is going to </span><span class="c4">surprise</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;us by calling us up to speak out of the audience. Bruce agreed that that would be a fun gag. Since she doesn&#39;t like surprises, she was a little miffed and said as much before our setting apart. The next day, Friday, Kent Wilson called us at 3:15 in the afternoon and asked us to speak on Sunday.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On Sunday, June 22nd, we spoke in Church, surprising not a few members of the ward who had missed the announcement the previous week. Bruce was thrilled to see his former team lead from work, Rick Winscot, sitting in the very back, who had driven all the way from Provo to hear us speak, and later counselled us, &quot;Thank you for the sweet messages you shared today. What mighty changes we experience, drive us into the Lord&#39;s hands. In his care, there is no fear&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
