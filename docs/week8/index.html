So, we attended the second ward at eleven. This is another very friendly ward. And, the ceremony after the closing prayer was extremely touching. A young man soon to leave on a mission stood just behind the pulpit while the congregation sang </span><span class="c8"><a class="c5" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha_%25CA%25BBOe&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1755458969322727&amp;usg=AOvVaw3WK17bzoGbvPedN3xXmLug">Aloha &#39;Oe</a></span><span>&nbsp;and most of the members went up to embrace and give leis and other gifts to him. The line was still going long after the song ended, and we were moved by this expression of love and support. Bruce imagined that his ward must have felt something similar when he left long ago </span><span>on mission</span><span class="c1">, but they had no cultural way to express it. The air show continued today, and Bruce went out to try to catch a glimpse of the jets. Sara agreed to drive and then got really excited to see the formations, as we drove to DLB&#39;s house and enjoyed a view of the Blue Angels. Later in the evening a very gentle rain cooled things down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday morning making phone calls. We hit pay dirt at 11:30 and were able to help our son hire a divorce lawyer, after trying off and on since March. We obtained a cashiers check and drove it into Honolulu. Sara parked in the Safeway parking lot and went shopping while Bruce walked the retainer check to the office on the 28th floor. Home again. In the afternoon we picked up the prescriptions at Longs Drugs. Phone calls from Eli and Helaman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday we left early for an appointment at 7:30am in Honolulu. We were delayed a little, but returned in plenty of time for the district council, where we were asked to participate in the training. Bought snacks/lunch at Taco Bell after driving home a different way. Naps. Dinner.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Wednesday we drove to Laie and went into the temple, but the last session of the morning was already in the past. The morning sessions run from 7am to the last one starting at 10am, and evening sessions start at 4:30pm. However, we met our stake president who was working at the </span><span>recommend</span><span>&nbsp;desk! We&#39;ve been trying to get in touch with him for a while, so that was good. We stopped in at the PCC for a few minutes. On the way back, we stopped for Huli Huli chicken which was good if a bit expensive. Shortly after that, the car started losing power and we pulled it off the road. We tried pushing it further off the road but couldn&rsquo;t. A nice man stopped and helped push it backwards further off the road and that worked. Meanwhile, Sara called Surfer Joe &mdash; who happened to be in Kailua &mdash; to come pick us up and drive us home for $40. We feared getting overheated and anyway had company coming to dinner. Sara thinks it is the fuel filter but Helaman thinks we&rsquo;re just out of gas. Jasmin &mdash; whom we called at work &mdash; thinks it might be the fuel pump and will take Bruce</span><span>&nbsp;to it to</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;take a look at it when he gets off work at 3:30pm. Oh, but he had an errand to run first, and Bruce tried to relax while waiting, but that is against his nature. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Here are pictures of the car and the sign Surfer Joe wrote for us to put in the windshield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 300.22px; height: 401.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 300.22px; height: 401.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 304.70px; height: 182.14px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 304.70px; height: 182.14px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is after we had pushed it backwards with the help of the good samaritan. An unfortunately timed picture because it looks like the road is deserted, when in reality it is extremely busy. The sign reads &quot;Car is broked [sic] down. called our mechanic is going to Fix or we will have it Towed before Dark If you have any questions please call us at [redacted] mr mrs conrad&quot;. We left it locked and with the sign clearly showing. There is a law in Hawaii against abandoning a car, so we were being careful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Jasmin came back to pick Bruce up at 4:30 and drove to the car (just south of the Poi Factory of Waiahole (the bridge over the Waiahole stream is behind the photographer in the picture above)). There, he opened the gas tank, leaned against the car and shook it violently while listening to the opening. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he said, &quot;out of gas, one hundred percent.&quot; So then they backtracked a couple of miles to the 7-Eleven by the roundabout, who did not sell gas cans. They walked across the road (on the crosswalks, </span><span>because&hellip; busy</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;highway at rush hour) to the Hygienic Store who sold a one gallon red plastic can for twenty bucks. They walked back to a pump and Jasmin filled it for Bruce &mdash; which was very nice of him, to get gas on himself instead of on the old missionary in white shirt and tie. (Bruce paid for everything of course, and hinted that he would pay Jasmin who waved it off with a &quot;your welcome&quot;). They drove back to the car and Jasmin figured out how the can worked (it was excessively complicated) and poured in the gallon of gas. He said he would follow Bruce, who drove to our parking spot at home. He got out to thank Jasmin who was a little irked that he hadn&#39;t driven directly to a gas station, and warned Bruce that one gallon isn&#39;t very much. Bruce, already chagrined by having run out of gas in the first place, was humbled at his lack of wisdom, but waved a thank you good bye to Jasmin as he drove off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Bruce walked in the door about ten minutes to six, and Sara asked him to run to Safeway to buy corn on the cob and a desert, reminding him that the sisters were coming to dinner in a few minutes. He drove to the nearest gas station (Aloha on the corner of Kamehameha Highway and Lilipuna Road), filled the tank with 11.2 gallons of gas (tank holds 11.9 gallons), and then shopped at Safeway as directed. We had a delightful dinner with Sisters Mobil and Anderson.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday was a big laundry day, and the SYS zoom conference. Working on getting a replacement part for our air fryer, starting with Sara phoning the Gourmia toll-free number, then continuing via email messages. The grille plate is starting to shed enamel. Gourmia would replace it on warranty but doesn&#39;t ship to Hawaii, so Bruce asked if they would ship to Utah and we could have Mike send it on to us. Bruce emailed Elder Whiting in the mission office to see if he could find the receipt, which he did! With all of that, it will be shipped. After a nap, we drove to the sisters apartment and Sara inspected it while Bruce started inspecting their car. Then they came out and operated controls while Bruce watched the rear lights, and Sara taught Sister Mobil how to check the oil level. We drove home and played SkipBo and snacked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday we are preparing for a meeting with some of the other senior couples that is to take place at the Institute building on the University of Hawaii campus at 6pm this evening. Sara cooked a great breakfast of fried eggs and potatoes. And later in the day, she made her delicious chicken broccoli casserole which we took to the senior couple gathering, via the Pali highway. We took a phone call from Daniel during the trip, and he sent us pictures of his work renovating homes. Sara spoke on his behalf to Elder Lowry (new employment and self-sufficiency expert) and we&#39;ll get the two of them together. It was a wonderful gathering and we heard from each couple about the miracles that brought them to the mission and some highlights. For the record, we arrived just a dozen minutes early, which is perfect for this event, so maybe our lateness earlier in the week was a glitch. We drove home from Honolulu after dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Saturday we are preparing to go shopping. Calls from Helaman, Jessica, Eli, and Daniel. We drove and shopped at </span><span>Sams</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Club which took a long time, and the checkout experience was terrible. Getting out of the parking lot and to the freeway seemed to take forever. We made it home in time to go to the bathroom and eat and nap. Later in the evening, a neighbor from across the way knocked on our door and we answered to learn that we had left our running lights on! From going through the tunnel on Like Like highway. Crab for dinner, and a movie.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The week has been humbling. Maybe we should just be content to be small and simple (Alma 37:6 (or as the Bible puts it, weak and foolish)).</span></p></body></html>
