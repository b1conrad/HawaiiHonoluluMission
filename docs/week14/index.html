Good sacrament meeting, with the Primary children doing the program. Sunday School class was sparsely attended, but invigorating, with Scott Hovey leading the discussion. We attended the missionary huddle afterwards. Picked up buffalo chicken wings on the way home, and Bruce spoke with Arlene on the phone while waiting for them to be ready. Good call. Naps and a SkipBo </span><span>game</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;filled out the afternoon, along with a phone call from Eli. Sara drove Bruce to choir rehearsal for men&#39;s voices at the stake center at 6pm. Upon our return, we parked in the visitor spot that the carpet cleaners will need tomorrow. At midnight, Bruce got up and moved the car back to our official spot, so that the car wouldn&#39;t be towed between 2am and 6am.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Monday, Bruce is expecting a phone call from Mitchell McClung, his financial advisor in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, at 9am. Also expecting carpet cleaners at 8am. In preparation, Bruce got up at 6am to move our car back into the visitor spot that will be needed by the carpet cleaning company. Visitor spots are </span><span>tow-away</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;from 2am to 6am, without a permit, that we didn&#39;t think ahead to obtain before the weekend. When Jake arrived, he preferred a different spot anyway, so Bruce moved the car back into our own spot. It took half an hour to set up all the equipment and then a couple of hours to steam clean the entire place. Here is a before and after and before collage:</span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 245.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 245.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We were about to say which parts are before, and which are after, but if the reader can&#39;t tell by looking, maybe we didn&#39;t need to have the carpets cleaned! After finishing, it took about fifteen minutes for him to pack up his equipment (except for the fans). He suggested a place where we could buy some remnants so that we can lay down some area rugs over the berber, which &mdash; &nbsp;as we may have mentioned &mdash; is hard on the feet. We drove to Pan&#39;s Kitchen for lunch and then into Honolulu to buy some carpet remnants. Upon our return, Bruce took the remaining two pieces of salvaged remnants to a Dumpster, and we brought in the new ones. We&#39;ll wait until the fans have finished drying everything before setting them down. Sara washed our smaller rugs and is just now bringing them in from air drying on the patio wall. Thankfully, the wind hadn&#39;t carried them away! We live on the &quot;windward&quot; side of the island, and enjoy an almost constant breeze (or more) off of the Pacific ocean to the East of us. In the evening, DLB texted to ask us if we could participate in a service project tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Tuesday, preparing for district council and the service project afterwards. Loading up the fans to take back to Jake. We got </span><span>to district</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;council just in time, and enjoyed meeting with the young sisters and elders. After, we stopped at Jack in the Box for lunch, then headed over to Eddie&#39;s place where we and a couple of sisters and three or four men from the ward helped him attach a brand new 20&#39;x26&#39; tarp to cover his workspace. We used bungee cords to attach the tarp to a metal framework. Then we drove off to Jake&#39;s house in Honolulu where we dropped off the fans. </span></p><p class="c5"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 405.50px; height: 566.09px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 405.50px; height: 566.09px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And then on to Costco. Bruce drove the return trip along the coast road. Fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday setting up carpet remnants, and waiting for sisters to be ready for apartment/vehicle inspections. Talking with Helaman, and phone calls from Jessica and Janis. The Internet has gone out a couple of times; we don&#39;t know who to contact about it, but so far it has come back each time. This makes us realize how dependent we are on it. Bruce had a good long talk with Elizabeth who was worried about her upcoming performance, in Rexburg. Hot day, ending with a quick shopping trip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Thursday we enjoyed a leisurely morning. We went out and inspected the apartment of sisters Anderson and Haycock, while Bruce copied down the VIN, and expiration dates to text to the Larsens (who are doing the </span><span>report this</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;transfer). Got back just in time for SYS. The president counselled us to find happiness in tribulation. Then we ran over to inspect the apartment of sisters Jones and Pugh, while Bruce copied down the same numbers for the same reason. There was a screw loose in a drawer pull which we fixed, using fingernails and nail clipper until Sara went out to the car and brought back in a toolbox with a couple of perfectly serviceable Philips screwdrivers. In the evening we responded to a call to receive two (boxes it turned out of) MREs from FEMA, which the ward was distributing to members who wanted them. Then we dropped off all of the remaining crafting materials that we had inherited from the Mundells at the home of the stake relief society president. At home, we tried out some of the things in one packet of MRE.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday was a big laundry day. And we spoke with four of our children, Jessica, Ammon, Eli, and Helaman. In the evening we met the sisters (Anderson and Haycock) at Fresh Catch and treated them to dinner and enjoyed a pleasant conversation, as they asked us questions about our lives and we talked about moving and transfers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday, Sara worked on her class while Bruce drove to Jiffy Lube for an oil change in the Scion. Helaman ordered buffalo wings for lunch, which Bruce picked up on the way home. More school work with Bruce helping Sara from time to time. Just before we watched the transfer zoom call, we learned that President Nelson had passed away. Very sad. But, we will carry on.</span></p></body></html>
