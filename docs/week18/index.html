There was a youth speaker and a high council speaker. In the Sunday School lesson, Bruce was asked for the opening prayer, and we contributed the story of being able to come here on a mission when the teacher asked how God had impacted our life. In the evening, Sara dropped Bruce off for choir practice, which he enjoyed and then got a ride home from Elder Chun.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Monday we left about 7am for the ocean. Showing a </span><span class="c8">faux</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;panorama (rotating from north to southeast) collage of photos all taken from our parked car before Bruce joined Sara (visible as a red dot) on the way to the water.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 256.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 256.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Bruce phoned our credit card company to ask about a text message we received apparently from them; it was from them and about an online payment they had refused because of something wrong in the billing address, they said. We joined the Larsons at the Kailua chapel for car cleaning at 2pm and it was just them and us. Sara sent a message to the whole zone asking the young missionaries to support them better. By the end of the day, they had cleaned and checked 7 of the 9 cars driven by young missionaries in our zone.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">We received a text message about us using way more electricity than the previous tenants and are busy taking pictures of A/C units so that a repair person can be called in; we&#39;re assuming there is something amiss with those units. Yeah, it does look pretty bad; the jump from July to August is definitely us, since we arrived June 30, but the month names are about a month behind because of the date (early in the month) when the measurement is made. The jump from June to July is due to the weather experienced by the previous tenants. Too bad we don&#39;t have similar charts for the previous two or three months so that we could see how they looked for the previous tenants.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 364.50px; height: 361.58px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 364.50px; height: 361.58px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Tuesday morning, Bruce got up early, inspired by a dream he had had to do a regular maintenance activity on his picos. They are okay, at 76% (they will crash at 100%) so still a ways to go. While looking for the electricity chart shown above, he came across this picture of deviled eggs. Sara makes these for every time we contribute food (along with her actual assignment), and they are always a big hit, and we always take home an empty plate. So, here is a before picture. The after picture is just the empty plate, left to the reader&#39;s imagination.</span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 388.92px; height: 292.70px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 388.92px; height: 292.70px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Before the sun comes up (or after sunset) when Bruce is on the front porch, he likes to block the screen door in the open position. It doesn&#39;t open all the way because the top hits the descending roof before it can get to that point; it opens most of the way but doesn&#39;t stay. So he uses a flip flop door stop; shown below.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 470.42px; height: 656.59px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 470.42px; height: 656.59px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span>This keeps the bright light from the parking area (just visible above the handrail) from getting in his eyes. Now, we are getting ready </span><span>for district</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;council in half an hour. Sister Sorensen gave the spiritual thought based on something from her grandmother, who called missionaries &ldquo;light bringers&rdquo; which seems true. We enjoyed the entire meeting, looked over a couple of cars, and returned home, picking up some tacos at Jack in the Box on the way.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Wednesday morning the alarm went off at 4:30am as Bruce had signed up for another day of seminary security. He enjoyed greeting everyone and helping the instructors with wheeled monitors. After locking up, he joined Sara in the chapel to sing </span><span class="c8">Gethsemane</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;again. We returned home to breakfast. We drove around the coast to Costco in East Honolulu and filled a basket with shopping. They didn&#39;t have one item we were looking for and so we called around and found it at the Waipio Costco and so we drove all the way there. Almost home and an A/C repairman called so we met him at the apartment and he cleaned the main unit, noting that the water drain hose must be plugged (Bruce thinks it leaks right below the unit onto the porch). The bedroom unit shows an E5 error code and Bruce drained some water out of it and it is working again. Sara is taking a bath, which she often does in the middle of the day when overheated. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Thursday we started at the ocean place just after 7am, and then came back for breakfast and went to the library to pick up a couple of books that Bruce had requested. We participated in the mission SYS zoom call. In the evening we will be going to a Relief Society social at 7pm. Our Bishop &mdash; who had just returned from a trip to Utah for a nephew&#39;s baptism &mdash; delivered us a knapsack of things that Eli and Mike worked together to get to him while in Utah. So nice to have a few things that we had been missing.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Friday we went out a couple of times. First, we saw two elders through the window, and Bruce went out to try to catch them. They were walking, and all the way up to Emepela Place and turning towards Haiku Road, so he shouted &quot;Hey!&quot; and they turned and waved. It turns out that they were the ones for whom we had received packages ordered by the Vogelsbergs. They had one more visit and then they drove into our parking lot, where Bruce was at the bottom of the stairs cleaning out our beach shoes, and he gave them the packages. In the evening, we went out to Safeway for the Friday specials and saw a set of sisters in the parking lot. They were so happy to see Sara because they had been discouraged and needed a hug from her.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4">Saturday we were at the church cleaning at 7:30am, and afterwards Bruce stayed to help set up for tonight&#39;s activity. Sara worked hard to put together her signature chicken broccoli casserole, which we got to the church in time and was a big hit. We had a good time talking to old and new friends, including some members of our ward that we hadn&#39;t met yet, and some visitors as well.</span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 418.67px; height: 248.77px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 418.67px; height: 248.77px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p></body></html>
