As we walked in, we were greeted by Sisters Hardy and Jarman. We had decided that Sara would take the cooler to the fridge in the kitchen while Bruce looked for the Bishop, but the ladies started talking, so Bruce walked across the gym towards the kitchen. A man greeted him, asking if he was visiting, and Bruce told him that we were here on behalf of a family that needed help with food, and the man identified himself as the Bishop! Bruce said, &quot;You&#39;re the man, then,&quot; and they walked on in their original directions. The Bishop, arriving at the sisters, greeted Sara by name (Sister Conrad) saying &quot;I&#39;ve already spoken with your husband.&quot; Sometimes, the Lord does a really tight choreography! The meeting started seconds later. After the sacrament meeting &mdash; which was a veritable delight of mostly youth speakers &mdash; he approached Bruce and told him that he would be with the youth, but to find him after the block. Then, with some coaxing via text messages, Daniel arrived shortly after the second hour began. </span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Funny story. We had been sitting in the foyer talking with the membership clerk, to whom we gave all the information we had about Daniel and the kids. The clerk pointed out a man outside walking away from the door and asked if that was him, and Bruce said no, that Daniel wasn&#39;t that big a man. Worried that he wasn&#39;t coming, Bruce went out into the parking lot, hoping that Daniel, arriving in his car, would see him. Then he saw Daniel&#39;s car, in the parking lot, with no one in it! Meanwhile the mystery man had turned around and was walking towards him and they recognized each other simultaneously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We introduced many of the ward members to him in the foyer, and the sister missionaries made an appointment to teach him and his kids on Tuesday afternoon. He appreciated everyone&#39;s firm handshakes. As people filtered out, Bruce had him come to the bishop&#39;s office to join the queue of people waiting to see him, and his turn came, last of all at about 1:30pm and we spoke with the Bishop. We were the second-last car to leave the parking lot as the bishopric locked the gates. We followed Daniel to a nearby gas station and filled his tank, and off-loaded to him a papaya, the cooler of food, and the three boxes of MREs that we had picked up on Friday. He asked Bruce if there was something special about the men he had seen around the bishop&#39;s office, that they looked more powerful than regular people, or was he just crazy? Bruce assured him that these men were called and set apart and that they were special, but that when they were released they would again just be regular people. Daniel liked that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We returned home along the coast, stopping to say hello to Elders Jimenez and Fowler whom we saw getting food from a truck in Waimanalo. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday morning, we did some banking and then drove into Honolulu for an important meeting, which did not go as we had hoped, but it could have gone badly, so we&#39;ll count it a win. Naps. Call from Daniel who got a small paying job; his son received his first paycheck from his job, so things are looking up for them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Tuesday we picked up the district leader and his companion at 9:30am and took them to the chapel </span><span>for district</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;meeting, since they are on bicycles. Bruce gave the spiritual thought, by invitation, and we gave them chocolates, one for each rejection that they got on their Open Your Mouth challenge the previous week. We shopped at Ross for storage containers and a couple of night dresses for Sara, while Bruce returned a book and checked out another one at the library. Shortly after we got home, we had an unfortunate experience and it took the rest of the day to unravel things; it ended well. We arrived at the bank in the nick of time to get a needed cashier&#39;s check, then drove into Honolulu to fill out needed paperwork on a concrete abutment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 311.00px; height: 171.20px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 311.00px; height: 171.20px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">[Thanks to Google street view for the location shot a dozen years ago (but it hasn&#39;t changed much) at the wrong time of day, but you can easily make out the makeshift &quot;office desk&quot; at the end of the ramp.] We got home just after dark, with Sara driving, on the Like Like highway, and texted Elder Olson that his package had been delivered, and they stopped by and his companion Elder Tesoro left us a message from D&amp;C 121 about enduring. We enjoyed our evening meal (purchased at Bo&#39;s Kitchen in Honolulu) and had a nice long talk with Helaman and went to bed about 10:16pm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday was a beautiful morning, just 70&deg; outside. Bruce took this picture of the palm trees from our porch, hoping to catch the orange sky just before sunrise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 396.50px; height: 349.68px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 396.50px; height: 349.68px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Today we plan to bake a turkey, clean the house, and spend some time in the genealogy library. Bruce went and paid the registration fee for the car we are borrowing from Helaman, while Sara put the turkey (brought to us by Elder Chun) into the oven. We attended the SYS meeting on zoom. In the afternoon, we drove to Hawaii Kai to be members during a missionary lesson, at a picnic table in the Koko Head Neighborhood Park, the one on the left [</span><span class="c6"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/maps/place/189%2BLunalilo%2BHome%2BRd,%2BHonolulu,%2BHI%2B96825/@21.2742351,-157.7059972,3a,75y,97.03h,94.93t/data%3D!3m7!1e1!3m5!1st3be1MiJrgvnfjXbonHlng!2e0!6shttps:%252F%252Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%252Fv1%252Fthumbnail%253Fcb_client%253Dmaps_sv.tactile%2526w%253D900%2526h%253D600%2526pitch%253D-4.932824398189666%2526panoid%253Dt3be1MiJrgvnfjXbonHlng%2526yaw%253D97.03010336337978!7i16384!8i8192!4m6!3m5!1s0x7c001264d59605b1:0x1ed92c79f854c27c!8m2!3d21.2743636!4d-157.7050525!16s%252Fg%252F11c16bz0tc?entry%3Dttu%26g_ep%3DEgoyMDI1MTEyMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%253D%253D&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1765130670916888&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ZtwrganoyGe9RbguegOcB">Google street view</a></span><span class="c1">].</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 307.23px; height: 176.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 307.23px; height: 176.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Afterwards, one of the sisters took a selfie</span><span class="c7">, which hopefully they will remember to text us</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 520.50px; height: 391.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 520.50px; height: 391.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Then, Sara drove to Costco and we shopped </span><span>for the dinner</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;tomorrow, then drove to a hotel to pick up Helaman&#39;s friends who had flown in earlier today.

Nice long talk with everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday (Thanksgiving Day, November 27, 2025), the temperature is 69&deg;, the coolest we&#39;ve experienced so far, but not the lowest ever recorded. Bruce went outside just before sunrise to capture these views of Christmas decorations &mdash; already installed here at Haiku Point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 589.27px; height: 257.43px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 589.27px; height: 257.43px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We worked hard to get our turkey, gravy, etc. to the chapel by 9:30am, and then made a fruit plate in the kitchen there. We all worked together to get the food set out in the gym (the tables and chairs had been set out the night before), while waiting for the guests to arrive. We had good conversations with several people there, including the branch president of the YSA branch (a medical doctor). The food was great, and Sara&#39;s gravy was a hit. We helped take everything down, and came home for a long postprandial nap, and gave Sara her diabetes shot. After we were settled in bed, we got a phone call from Ammon with a bit of bad news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday morning Ammon called us again and we are trying to advise him. We also managed to be double-booked for this morning, with both a lesson and a service project at the same time; working it out. We worked hard at pulling weeds with Cary, a diver who had been contacted years ago by a sister missionary who stayed in contact with him. We were with Elders Crosbie and Kam, who gave him a short lesson on the Sabbath day and invited him to come to church. He is reluctant, and told us many stories about his life. We came home and Helaman ordered wings, which we picked up later while going to the bank to cash a check and deliver packages received for Elder Kam. After eating, we met Elder Olson and Tesoro at the Waikalua chapel where the former practiced the fourth lesson with us. We returned to pick up Brent and take him to catch his flight at the airport, then went shopping at Costco for a dehumidifier. Finally, we drove to the Hawaii Kai chapel where we spoke with Daniel, then attended a lesson from Sisters Jarman and Hardy with the Colton family in attendance. From Costco on, Sara had been on the phone with Ammon and Jessica, as he agonized over what to do about his problem. Sara drove home, with us arriving well after 9pm, making this a very long day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday morning was a degree cooler, at 68&deg; &mdash; very nice for November, but it is clear and the high is expected to be 80&deg; with the strong tropical sun. This will be a laundry day, among other things. We drove to the Kahala ward chapel to meet the sisters and Daniel to view a baptism, a first for him. We ate at Panda Express in the mall nearby, then drove home. Naps. With help from Sara, Bruce installed the wheels at the bottom of the dehumidifier.</span></p></body></html>
