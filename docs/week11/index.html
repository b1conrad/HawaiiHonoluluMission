Getting ready for church, Sara felt she needed to stay home, so Bruce went </span><span>way</span><span>&nbsp;early, and that worked out well, as our Bishop was able to sit down with him for half an hour and discuss the needs of the ward that we could help with. When the youth arrived, Bruce went out into the hallway and had a nice long visit with Big-T and got to know him better, including that he had been bishop of the ward years ago. Then, Brother Adams asked if we had an assignment yet, and Bruce mentioned meeting the stake president in the temple a couple weeks ago, and he pointed him out, leaving the stand (apparently he had presided at the previous ward meeting), so Bruce went over and shook his hand, and he thanked us for our work with the ward, implying that that indeed was our assignment. We&#39;ll take that as an indication and get to work here. The first talk was an introduction from Sister Haycock, and then we had the pleasure of hearing from the bishop&#39;s wife, who gave a stirring talk. Humor starting out was that a bishop&#39;s wife doesn&#39;t have any perks (special parking spot, etc.), but one is that she never has to speak in sacrament meeting. She teased the counselor who asked her to speak. It was great to hear about her marriage many years ago, in Fiji, where she didn&#39;t know the language and only knew her in-laws, and some of her trials, including smallpox. How her self-talk was negative and how she got over that. Her talk left a little time in the meeting and the counselor gave a good follow-up talk about the dangers of negative self-talk and how to recover from it. A fun thing happened during the second hour lesson, when the teacher asked why we do missionary work. Bruce piped up that what&#39;s in it for us is joy, the joy of being an instrument in the Lord&#39;s hand. Before he finished, people started tittering, and he looked up to see that the slide now had the word &quot;Joy&quot; centered on &nbsp;screen in a big font! Got that one right! Fun to guess the next line in a </span><span class="c5">movie</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;presentation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 589.82px; height: 265.37px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 589.82px; height: 265.37px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The setting of the chapel (our stake center) is just beautiful, if you like mountains as Bruce does.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Monday, we began planning for the lunch we need to prepare for the zone conference on Wednesday. We&#39;ve been texting around, trying to find out who has the keys to the Keolu ward chapel, because we need to store some things in its refrigerator beforehand. Shopping trip to Costco, which was closed! So, we went to Sam&#39;s Club because it was nearby, even though we promised never to go there again. Pretty bad experience, again. Only after things are rung up can you see what the charges were, and then when you spot a mistake, you have to deal with it. There has been a mistake every single time we&#39;ve shopped there. A nap in the afternoon, then we met Sisters Jones and Pugh at Golden Pho for dinner and had fun sharing stories with them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 481.00px; height: 639.66px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 481.00px; height: 639.66px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Tuesday morning, we enjoyed sleeping in just a little bit. Continuing to </span><span>plan the lunch</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for tomorrow. We attended the district council meeting and enjoyed watching the young missionaries teach each other. Elder Hirschi had the keys to the Keolu chapel, which he lent us. Then we went to try to get a prescription renewed, but will have to wait until the 7th. Looking for boric acid, because Sara is suffering from pink eye. In drugstores it is used for vaginal cleansing. Not what we&#39;re looking for. We came home to Helaman distressed by the divorce settlement and the cost of lawyers. We drove twenty minutes to the Keolu chapel to place a tub of ice cream, two gallons of milk, and four cases of soda pop in the refrigerator there to chill for tomorrow. Ordered some tacos from Jack in the Box, and picked those up. Also on the way back, we called around and found that City Mill (a local hardware store) had boric acid. In a hardware store it is used for pest control. Not what we&#39;re looking for. We met the elders at the stake center gate to return the keys for tomorrow. Home to rest for a bit. Sara ordered boric acid online: that&#39;s the way things are done nowadays. We worked on food preparation (cutting broccoli and cauliflower, washing and wrapping potatoes) until ten-thirty and tumbled into bed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday we awoke to plan our movements for the morning. We started by driving to Safeway, where we bought a tub of guacamole, one of b-sauce, and 60 plastic cups. As we approached the checkout, we heard someone call out, &quot;Elder, Sister!&quot; The woman supervising the self checkout has been a member since March, and our being there, she said, brightened her day, and we were able to share comforting words and feelings. She had been praying that morning for some kind of guidance. We were grateful to be in the right place at the right time. We returned home and added our purchases to the big box we had prepared the night before. Bruce took it down to the car and drove to the Keolu chapel, arriving well before 9am and worked steadily setting up tables and getting things ready, until we went into the chapel at 9:45. Once again, Bruce enjoyed greeting the mission president with a cheery, &quot;Bonjour, Monsieur le pr&eacute;sident!&quot; A few minutes into the prelude, Elder and Sister Chun walked in, newly called service missionaries and our mission leaders came down from the stand to greet them, and Bruce followed them and waited his turn to greet them. The mission president&#39;s opening remarks centered around the dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland temple, and he had verses 21-23 read (by our sister Haycock), pointing out that the Lord is quick to forgive us when we repent quickly after a transgression, that we have been endowed with power, and that angels watch over us (often, he suggested, our own deceased ancestors).</span></p><p class="c0"><span>At 10:05am, Sara texted that the potatoes were done (they had been in the oven since before Bruce had left home), and so Bruce returned immediately (a twenty minute drive). While waiting for the peach cobbler to bake, we drove to a store to get some herbal medicines. Then, loaded up the potatoes (60 of them, all foil wrapped and baked (36 white bakers and 24 red potatoes)), and the peach cobbler into the car and drove back to the meeting together. We worked hard with the Larsons and the Petersons to get everything ready and out on the serving tables (except for milk and ice cream and other things that couldn&#39;t just sit out). We then were able to go into the chapel for Sister Jones&#39;s testimony before leaving at the end of her eighteen months, Sister Andersen&#39;s talk, and the first part of President Andersen&#39;s presentation. Then we slipped out and did some more setting out of things, while listening </span><span>for</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the closing hymn (It is well with my soul), and went out to be a part of the zone conference photo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Our lunch was well-received, and the peach cobbler was a favorite. We took home half a dozen potatoes, half the milk, most of the cups, and much of the soda pop. Three of the sister missionaries found Bruce&#39;s hat and sunglasses and took pictures of each other wearing them, reproducing some meme (someone returning from somewhere), but Bruce forgot what it was. After cleaning up, with Elder Peterson helpfully carrying our boxes to the car, we went home and enjoyed some cheerful conversation with Helaman, and naps, then some food, and retired for the night. Bruce noticed that the temperature sensor we have in our shed (which also houses refrigerators and freezers) had stopped sending information, and so </span><span class="c7"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/Picolab/PLAN/issues/30&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1757258119970119&amp;usg=AOvVaw1LmeBGglfhaRyB-o9YGeeU">fixed the program</a></span><span>&nbsp;to deal with </span><span>that situation</span><span class="c2">, all while worrying about the possibility that all power was off in the shed. That worry damaged his sleep a little, as he chose fear over faith.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thursday morning, we called Calvin Bennett, our neighbor and ministering brother, and asked him to go check the power at the shed. Thank you, Calvin, for taking care of us!</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 204.95px; height: 110.12px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 204.95px; height: 110.12px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All was well, and Bruce wryly regretted lacking belief that all was well at home. We played a game of Skip-Bo and ate breakfast. Preparing for a couple of meetings in Honolulu. Attending the SYS meeting, online, via Zoom, in which our president was inspiring. We drove to a building near the airport to deliver a couple of things to someone we had met over the phone, but not before in person. Then we drove to Lowes to return some things that it turns out we didn&#39;t need. Then we went to the International Market of Waikiki, and met Denise where she works, for lunch. Not pictured are Bruce, and Sara&#39;s Loco Moco which she said was the best ever.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 321.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 321.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span>On the way home we stopped at the Honolulu Sam&#39;s Club, just to see how it was, and it was much better than the one we hadn&#39;t liked. We found some bargains on things we needed anyway, so even though we had planned on just looking, it was shopping. Home </span><span>via Like Like</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Highway. The boric acid shipment was in the mailbox.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday dawned a beautiful day, as is every day here in Hawaii. Got some small bad news from Mike Perry. The kitchen garbage disposal has stopped working, and he is investigating. He also reset the sensor in the shed so it&rsquo;s working again. He sent us a picture of a suspicious envelope. Sure enough, Quest Diagnostics is starting to claim we owe them money again. Bruce will call DMBA to get to the bottom of it. Again. On the plus side, Mike reported extending our chain link fence. It looks much nicer now, as shown by the wonky collage below, in which two very different views are shown. On the left, a snapshot from two years ago, taken in the early morning, and showing no fence on one side of the steps into our yard, and on the right a snapshot taken today in the early evening showing twenty feet of new fence on that side of the same steps. The snapshots are taken from very different angles, but Bruce aligned them by matching up the big cottonwood tree in the schoolyard across the street.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 322.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 322.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With some help from Helaman, we discarded one of the five pieces of carpeting that we had borrowed to make our flooring more congenial to our feet. We had a brief visit from Elders Fowler and McElroy who were picking up some copies of the Book of Mormon, and left a message from 3 Nephi 27:14-16, reminding us that we may be &quot;[held] guiltless&quot; on judgement day if we repent, thanks to the atonement of Jesus Christ.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday, after a lovely breakfast that Sara prepared, spent some time explaining the RSS feed of this mission blog to Ellen and John in an email message. Sent some messages trying to find out who the missionaries are in the Aiea ward, where we plan to attend church with Daniel tomorrow. Finally got a hold of the three elders from that ward, and a senior couple who will be there. Did some shopping and found a few items we had been looking for for some time. In the evening, popcorn and a movie.</span></p></body></html>
