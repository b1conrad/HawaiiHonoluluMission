There were four former bishops of the ward on the program; three of them spoke, and Elder Chun sang </span><span class="c2">O Holy Night</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as a solo, which was fabulous. We were surprised to be given a gift and card from the Longs, with messages in Hawaiian, French, and English.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 485.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 485.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>On Monday we </span><span>attended district</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;council with 6 new missionaries and 4 that we knew from before. It was a good meeting. Sara was able to get an appointment with a dentist at noon and got a prescription for amoxicillin. Talk with Helaman. Long phone call from Daniel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Tuesday morning, Sara must have been feeling better because she was up and cleaning the kitchen, including behind the refrigerator. Bruce drove to deliver a package or two, but only got one done; the sisters had left by the time he got there. He stopped at MacDonald&#39;s to check the address of the Kailua library and found that it didn&#39;t open until noon, so he returned home and </span><span>read sitting</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;on the front porch. Then, Helaman ordered wings, so Bruce went to get those and tried to sell the empty cans and bottles, but got there just as they closed for lunch break. He stopped at the bank to withdraw some cash and then picked up the wings. At 4pm we joined the elders in our ward to teach a friend and invite her to church. Mike sent us pictures of mail received in Orangeville and deposited Bruce&#39;s Canadian dollar check.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday, Bruce went out at 8:30am and did all the things that didn&#39;t get done yesterday: deliver a package to Sister Krupp; get books at the Kailua library; sell the empties. He got home just in time for the SYS zoom call at 10am, but at 10:02 it was announced in messenger that it will be tonight at 7:30pm, which makes sense, since the young missionaries need to be indoors at 6pm on Christmas Eve (as on most holidays). We went out shopping for food and joined the meeting a little late, but got to hear the mission leaders speak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday was Christmas day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Friday, we drove to an appointment in Honolulu at 10am. We received a package for Elder Olson, and coincidentally, he asked for more copies of the Book of Mormon. They dropped by to pick them just after 4pm. We received a nice card from Michelle Robinson&#39;s family, telling us that Andy &quot;will be somewhere there for a couple days in January, planting a winter grow-out research project&quot; so that will be interesting, maybe. In the evening the downstairs neighbor started barbequing (which smells really strongly in our bedroom), so we opened up a window in the living area, stopped the air conditioners and dehumidifier and went for a drive. We got to the fruit stand just as they were closing and they gave us a coconut; we drove on to the hamburger place but they had just closed when we arrived; we turned around and came back into town and watched the movie </span><span class="c2">Song Sung Blue</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in the theater in the mall, which was really good. Bed at around 9:40pm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday, Bruce sat on the front porch for the sunrise. Getting ready for refrigerator delivery sometime today between ten and two. The online tracking system is broken. We got a text &quot;happy holidays&quot; from Bruce&#39;s cousin Callie (n&eacute;e Darlene Conrad) and replied. In the mail there was a card for SIster Krupp and so we texted them; they had a cancellation and dropped by to pick it up along with a dozen Books of Mormon. Home Depot called a twenty minute warning but then arrived even sooner. We hustled to get everything out in time, putting it in containers on the couch under blankets and pillows. Two men took away the old fridge and then brought in and installed the new one. We went to join the missionaries who met with Cary, getting there before them and leaving afterwards. When we got home, we put everything back into the new fridge, which, sadly, is just a little bit smaller on the inside. But at least it should be cold enough. It isn&#39;t yet, as we go to bed, but we trust that it will during the night.</span></p></body></html>
