It was a great meeting, with talks from the Bishop, President Candari, and President Ramanlal, who (the latter) also led a discussion in the second hour on ministering. Bruce was asked to give the closing prayer. We drove home to pick up our GoGurts because we don&#39;t want them and won&#39;t be seeing our grandchildren, and then drove them to Rocky&#39;s house to offer them to her. She asked for a few weeks before we could come and see her and Wes. We&#39;ll have to plan a visit, sandwiched between then and late October, when they are going on a trip to Montana to drive their motor home down to Arizona to sell it. After dropping in on her, we drove back to Kaneohe to shop a bit and ate lunch at Zippy&#39;s which Sara has always wanted to try.</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.53px; height: 351.51px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 624.53px; height: 351.51px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The food was acceptable, and not terribly expensive, but also not zippy, as it required a longer wait than we had hoped. Home to nap.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Monday we shared scripture study, breakfast, and started a load of laundry. Then, after that we&#39;ll head over to the chapel </span><span>for district</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;council. It was a good meeting. We enjoyed role playing during the lesson by sisters Pugh and Jones. Below is a collage of two shots of the bay; on the left taken from the chapel parking lot, looking across through the graveyard to the bay at noon-ish; on the right taken from our porch mid-afternoon. The water color varies wildly depending on the time of day. The conical trees, we are told, always lean towards the equator.</span></p><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 564.50px; height: 245.16px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 564.50px; height: 245.16px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the way home, we stopped at City Mill to buy a bag of potting soil. Bruce is going to try to save a root-bound papaya plant that we found discarded near the garbage bin a few weeks ago (as somewhat later we found a pot the right size in the same place).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tuesday morning was our Zone&#39;s turn to attend a session at the temple. Everyone from our zone was in attendance (for the first time (we know this because it is our first time with them all)). We felt inspired to do a small daily sacrifice going forward. Afterwards, we visited the distribution center to price things, and took a few pictures (collaged below).</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 573.13px; height: 430.10px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 573.13px; height: 430.10px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the way back, we stopped at the Times store, just outside of Kaneohe and purchased some fruit and vinegar. Ate leftover fish and salad. Napped. We shopped for a small piece of furniture we decided we needed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wednesday, Bruce went outside just after sunrise, when the temperature was 75&deg;, and repotted the papaya plant. He needs another bag of potting soil. Bruce drove us to the Costco at the far east end of Honolulu, around the coast. It was fun. We snacked there on a hot dog and slice of pizza, Sara got her hair trimmed nearby, and then we shopped for ourselves and for the luncheon for mission leaders tomorrow (a fruit salad). He also drove us home along the H1 freeway, a first for him since we&#39;ve arrived on our mission. A brief shopping expedition in the evening, looking for a plate to present deviled eggs, which we didn&#39;t find, so we&#39;ll work around that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thursday, we&#39;re preparing for the luncheon, briefly interrupted by the SYS conference call at 10am. We&#39;re planning to arrive at the stake center at 12:15pm. Hard at work, peeling eggs, cutting up fruit, etc. Bruce enjoyed the meeting, and Sara was working away on the fruit salad. President Andersen spoke on facing difficulties, citing his father as having told him that everything that happened to him was either his own fault, or would be for his good. We got to the stake center early and rested a bit in the air-conditioned chapel. The mission leaders were half an hour behind on their interviews, but we finally got to enjoy lunch with them, and the Petersons and Larsons who worked with us on it. Home again, and planning to go out to a baptism at 5pm. The baptism service was great. The talk on baptism was based around a bowl of light and then stones were added to it to weigh it down. We can return to light by tipping the bowl. Much Hawaiian was spoken. It was great. Sara briefly told our meeting and marrying story to Sister Andersen, which was fun. Bruce named some people he knew fifty years ago, none of whom she knew, but she said it was thirty years ago for them. Brother Kamuela Kimokeo (second counselor in ward bishopric) who was conducting spoke about how our Heavenly Father knows us by name, and asked the mission president to say a few words. He spoke of the fact that we make covenants before we really understand the full implications, but we trust in the Lord&#39;s goodness and feel joy as we do our part and learn. Program below (and apparently online somewhere as well).</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 192.72px; height: 255.96px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 192.72px; height: 255.96px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 171.50px; height: 255.75px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 171.50px; height: 255.75px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 194.55px; height: 256.04px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 194.55px; height: 256.04px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Friday, Bruce went out at sunrise and enjoyed being outdoors among the palm trees while it was still a comfortable temperature. We sent off payments for federal and state taxes for last year. Big laundry day inside, and a lot of tree trimming and wood chipping going on outside. We need to go to the library today, and then prepare for the seniors dinner tonight in Makakilo. we didn&rsquo;t go to the library, but napped instead. Then Sara made deviled eggs while Bruce started cutting up fruit and together we made a fruit salad. Sara prepared gluten free pasta which we took in the crockpot. Had a nice evening visiting with the couples at our table. Sara drove home in the dark and we were in bed at 9:18pm. </span></p><p class="c2"><span>Saturday after breakfast we played a game of </span><span>skipbo</span><span>&nbsp;and then remembered the activity day at the stake center. We got there on time. Bruce is planning to just sit on the couch in the foyer. President Ramanlal came and asked him to anoint for a blessing he gave to a 96 year old sister. Gratifying to be in the right place at the right time! Had to squeeze the (metal) vial to get a bit (less than a drop) of oil. Need to refill. Sara </span><span class="c1">enjoyed</span><span>&nbsp;loved her</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;classes, and Bruce enjoyed reading our missionary journal from twelve years ago while sitting on the couch in the foyer. One of the organizers came by and asked Bruce to join the catered lunch, so he did, being about the only male. Afterwards, he joined the other elders from our ward in taking down the tables and chairs, and Sara helped with the table centerpieces. While taking some things out to the car, Bruce ran into a couple of the sisters who took a selfie with him and had him take pictures of them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 618.50px; height: 460.35px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 618.50px; height: 460.35px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Addendum: this picture from the senior dinner on Friday.</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 265.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 265.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sorensen, Vogelsberg, Hurd, Andersen, Jones, Hollingsworth, Mangum, Chun, Clawson, Conrad, with thanks to Elder Clawson who set it up on a timer.</span></p></body></html>
