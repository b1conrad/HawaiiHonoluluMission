Bruce especially enjoyed listening to Elder Evanson, who was born in his home town (born a couple of months after Bruce graduated from high school). A little disappointed that there were no new temples announced, but it makes sense. We had a lovely visit from Sister Haycock and her new companion, SIster Krupp (who has been on the island only four days!). We were able to tell them a story from our previous mission, and give them some pizza and eggs. (Funny story about the pizza. It took two hours to have it delivered, and then right after, a neighbor came (from the same apartment number (letter actually) in an adjacent building) asking if this stack of pizzas was for us! So, because of the mixup we ended up with twice as much pizza.) We learned how it came about that Elder McElroy was transferred to the other mission: he had been given a dual call, to both missions. This is apparently fairly common, at least in our mission.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>&nbsp;Monday, getting ready </span><span>for district</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;meeting. The new district leader has sent out a detailed agenda. We mailed the monthly rent/utilities check and made it to the meeting on time. It was a well-run meeting. We promised to bring donuts next week as a reward for them following one of the schedules with integrity. Agenda shown here as texted, alongside a transcript for readability:</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 534.07px; height: 367.80px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 534.07px; height: 367.80px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Tuesday was the Kaneohe Zone temple day for this transfer. We had an assigned session at 9:30am, and so arrived at 9am. Sara took this picture of most of the elders outside, before.</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 421.50px; height: 332.22px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 421.50px; height: 332.22px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">After the session, there were many pictures taken. We chose this one for our journal:</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 538.80px; height: 400.80px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 538.80px; height: 400.80px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Back row: Elders Malabad, Larsen, Crosbie, Tesoro, Hamblin, Hirschi, Fowles, Hess, Olson, Cannon, Fowler, and Conrad; Front row: Sisters Larsen, Taumoefolau, Rosales, Webster, Workman, Sorensen, Pugh, Krupp, Haycock, and Conrad</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Afton Jones was at the temple! Her parents came to the island to tour with her before taking her home. After the pictures, we followed the Larsens to their favorite place to eat, Keneke&#39;s Grill at Punalu&#39;u, where we ordered their special &mdash; two cheeseburgers and a drink &mdash; for ten dollars. We tolerated some cats (not pictured) who were begging at the tables.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 517.86px; height: 391.41px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 517.86px; height: 391.41px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We went home to pick up some things, and then had to turn around and go right out again. At 2pm, we arrived at the Kailua chapel where we met up with most of the young missionaries for a car wash and then their activities. Elder Mangum, the mission vehicle coordinator, decided to drive over from Honolulu to &quot;meet the troops&quot;. It was sunny and dry on his side of the mountains, but on our side there was fairly steady rain. We cleaned our car thoroughly for the first time. It was hot and sweaty, but also at the same time cool, work. We drove home for naps. In the evening, we did a first shopping trip for Thursday&#39;s Zone Conference at Target, netting real bacon bits and powder for making Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing. Then we went and bought a taco and a pizza. Before going to sleep, we worried over (our contribution to) the menu for the conference lunch.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Wednesday will be a long day of shopping and preparing food </span><span>for zone</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;conference tomorrow. Bruce drove around the coast directly to the Costco in East Honolulu, where we enjoyed their leisurely shopping experience. Drove back along the H1 freeway and the Like Like highway. Once four salad containers were full of greens, we drove them over to the sisters who made some room in their fridge and will bring them to the conference. On the way back, we stopped at Target and Bruce returned some expensive bacon bits (we had found them twice as cheap in Costco) while Sara renewed a prescription. Bruce grated carrots and Sara cut up artichoke hearts and palm hearts. Bruce washed thirty potatoes and then Sara greased them with Crisco while Bruce warped them in foil and placed them in a pan. They will spend the night in the oven (off). We raced on a crossword puzzle and now are tired enough to sleep. It is 9:17pm. </span></p><p class="c3"><span>Flashback. Today, we heard from Warren Antoine; things are going well in Mauritius, where we served twelve to ten years ago. One of the men we saw baptized there, Clairel Ladouceur, is now one of the branch presidents! I was privileged to baptize Sister Ladouceur, while the group leader (of the dependent group which later became a branch) baptized the other three. Bruce found this picture from </span><span class="c5">May 24, 2014</span><span>&nbsp;(Queen Victoria&#39;s birthday; a holiday in Canada)</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 608.76px; height: 456.07px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 608.76px; height: 456.07px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Back row: Elder and Sister Conrad, Elder Estrade, Brother Ladouceur, Brother Gracieuse, Frank Moussa, Elder Choi; front row: Sister Ladouceur and their children. Flashback over. </span></p><p class="c3"><span>Thursday one of us got up early, to sit on the porch and watch the sunrise. There are reports of snow in Utah; how far away that seems on this 73&deg; morning! Overnight, some apple bananas &mdash; that we bought just yesterday totally green &mdash; ripened. The funny part is that I chose this batch from among all of the very green batches because there were three that had (and still have) a little bit of yellow. Surprisingly, the bigger bunch of the batch ripened first even though it was considerably greener than the smaller bunch. You can also see our SkipBo cards and various condiments on our table cloth. The magazine is a quarterly for Kaneohe that Bruce enjoys reading; it is open to an article on &quot;boomboxes&quot;, </span><span class="c5">k&#257;&#39;eke&#39;eke</span><span class="c0">, which anciently were drums made of hollow bamboo or coconut trunks. The feather is one of those we collect as signs of peace.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 664.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 664.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span>It is now 8:30am and we are going to load up the car and head out </span><span>to Zone</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Conference in the Honolulu West stake center. We arrived shortly after 9am, getting there just after the Andersens from the Honolulu West Zone, who were hosting. We worked steadily getting things into the kitchen, chopping vegetables for the salads, laying things out on the serving tables, etc. until about 11:30am when we went into the chapel to join everyone for the final session. Just before that, a man in a chair rolled into the building looking for a bishop so that he could get a food order. We explained how it worked to him, and Sister Conrad asked if he wanted to know more about the gospel. Just then a couple of elders came out on break and Bruce asked them if they spoke Samoan, which they did, and introduced them to the man; they took over. The last session was inspiring. &nbsp;After the prayer we gathered for a picture.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 226.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 226.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The senior couples served the meal and then we quickly ate ourselves and began the cleanup. During that time the young missionaries played a conference talk trivia game with the mission leaders. At one point, they asked all the senior missionaries to join them and gave us a big thank you and round of applause. The young missionaries of our zone took a picture (with a mission leader </span><span class="c5">photo bombing</span><span class="c0">).</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 344.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 344.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">We were so tired that we changed plans and instead of shopping for ourselves and gassing up while in Honolulu we just drove straight home and went to bed.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Friday morning we slept in a bit. Had a scare about electricity being turned off in Utah and got to the bottom of it; Ben will take care of it. Laundry day. Shopping in the afternoon.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Saturday dawned early. Well, the sun actually rose at the appointed time, but we got up early. We are going to help clean the chapel this morning at 7:30am. Done and back home by 8:30, for a nap, lunch, cooking up a bunch (too much) of hamburger that we bought yesterday because Safeway has low prices on Friday. It is so hot today! A pair of sisters phoned us because they </span><span>are</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;too hot. They don&#39;t have air conditioning, and the fans are just blowing hot air. Hawaiians (we are told) use cross-ventilation to cool their homes, but you have to have windows on opposite sides of a room for that to work, and they are in a corner unit. Sara wrote a letter to Sister Vogelsberg pleading for them. We had a nice visit with Helaman, ate supper, and went to bed.</span></p></body></html>
