In the morning, we </span><span>enjoyed sacrament</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;meeting. There were more people than usual, and it turned out to be the farewell talk of one of the young men of the ward. Both Elder Yadao and his father gave powerful talks. He is leaving soon for his mission to Ogden, Utah (and Bruce showed him a picture of the Muellers (whom he may meet in the mission office there)). Bruce enjoyed associating with the brethren of the ward in Priesthood Meeting. Afterwards, we spent some time talking with a few of the members. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the evening, we drove to the tabernacle in Honolulu and prepared for the baptismal service for Denise and Danny.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 422.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 422.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elders Ames and Conrad, Taye (a priest in the ward), Denise, Danny, and Elder Russell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bruce was privileged to baptize Denise, and Sara gave a great personal talk about the gift of the Holy Ghost. We enjoyed visiting with members of the Manoa Ward afterwards, along with some of the senior missionaries, the mission leaders, and Bruce met the stake president. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many pictures were taken during the socializing, including this one of us with them and the Lelegrens, who serve in the mission office, and met us at the airport.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 301.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 301.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here is another picture, this one of Danny surrounded by a cloud of friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 436.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 436.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When that cheerful gathering broke up, we drove them back to their apartment, stopping at a nearby Jack in the Box, where service took nearly an hour! We were so hungry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 467.78px; height: 350.83px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 467.78px; height: 350.83px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We didn&#39;t get home until nearly eleven, as we stopped to shop at both Safeway and Longs Drugs on the way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday morning, it was only 74&deg;, so I stepped onto the porch to write there. But a sprinkle of rain sent me back inside. We did a shopping run to the Costco in Waipio, and people were quite friendly this time. A man said, &quot;Hi, Elder,&quot; to Bruce in passing. We delivered a part of our purchases to the sisters&#39; apartment. It was one that we hadn&#39;t seen before, but with a bit of instruction, Bruce was able to walk the food inside and stow it in their refrigerator. Aaron wrote and delivered a letter showing that we live here, and that we hope to use to obtain a library card. At 2pm, we had a visit from a couple of technicians who calibrated things in our apartment. Naps caught up with us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday morning, our son showed us a carpet beetle, and we have quite a few in our guest room. So after the district council, we went to a plant store and purchased a bag of diatomaceous earth. For lunch we ate buffalo wings. Bruce felt impressed to share our baptism story with our bishop and stake president, who were pleased to hear from us. We had some fun talks with our son in the evening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday morning, we drove to the Laie temple, and got there just in time to join a sealing session. We saw quite a few people from our ward, and that was thrilling. Then we spent some time in the celestial room. On the way out, a small family clearly not dressed for the temple were trying to negotiate entry at the recommend desk. Bruce decided to go back in and offer them guidance to the visitor center. It turned out that they were from France, and he enjoyed speaking with them as they walked down the stairs. Meanwhile, Sara was visiting with a group of people and telling them stories from our mission to Mauritius. When we got back, we had a ministering kind of visit from DLB, and pizza that Helaman ordered and had delivered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Thursday, we are up and getting ready for the weekly Zoom meeting, called SYS, at 10am. We got a phone call from an unknown number and it turned out to be Kamish Castro from fleet services, wanting to confirm that we should not be charged the leasing fee of $150/month for a church car. We verbally confirmed that, and he asked us to ask our bishop if we had been charged for that. We had, on August 5th, so we let him know and he said that he will take care of getting the charge reversed and ensuring the automatic action doesn&#39;t continue to happen. Even though our bishop has a full-time job, he was super responsive and we can only assume he has on-line access to all of the ward accounts. We had feared that he might have to involve a clerk in getting the answer, and that we might not be able to respond the same day as we had been asked. We felt the spirit at a few points during the Zoom meeting, which is kind of a first as we get used to meeting through technology. We are not digital natives like the young missionaries are. We </span><span>are</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>planning the lunch</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at the zone conference, so we knew we would need to refrigerate some things the day before and asked who had the keys to the building. Turns out we had been thinking of the wrong building! The zone leader has reserved a different building, which is twenty-five minutes away, so this complicates our logistics. We asked the mission secretary who told us that the zone leaders are responsible for letting people know which building, and they did, when I asked them if they had the keys to the nearby building (which they do). We will gradually learn how things work and what are the communication paths. Our apartment heated up to 82&deg; and we are sweltering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday wasn&#39;t quite as hot. We enjoyed a crab lunch. Most of the day was spent making phone calls and otherwise trying to set up appointments.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday, we got up early and drove to the Kualoa Regional Park where we got wet, cleaned the car, and took a couple of pictures (Bruce was in water both the first and last days of this week).</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 278.53px; height: 300.90px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 278.53px; height: 300.90px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 184.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 184.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>On the way home, we stopped at a yard sale; nothing interesting, but it allowed us to explore some new territory. We received a long and most welcome phone call </span><span>from the Lowrys</span><span class="c0">, our mission employment specialists. We shared D&amp;C 78:5-6 with them, and they shared D&amp;C 34:38 with us. They visit a ward during RS and Priesthood for a couple of minutes to explain their purpose and then recruit someone in the ward to work with them. We facilitated them making an appointment with Daniel, and sent them some pictures of his work. Buffalo wings for lunch, then naps. In the evening, Sisters Anderson and Haycock came to have us do some printing for them. Retired after nine, exhausted.</span></p></body></html>
