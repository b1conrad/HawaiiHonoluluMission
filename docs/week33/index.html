We got to church in plenty of time and met some new friends there and experienced a wonderful set of testimonies, after the meeting got underway with a baby blessing and the confirmation of Aaliyah, with so many of her extended family there to support her. We left before the second meeting to take Denise and her son to the doctors, and it ended up somewhat tragically, because she lost her smart phone somewhere and that is devastating. Sometimes you try to do something nice to help someone and then it doesn&#39;t turn out. We are so sad for her but don&#39;t know how we could make it better. In the end, she was able to locate it! An answer to our prayers. One of the zone leaders came by with a package for us to give to the mission president tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 402.50px; height: 529.66px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 402.50px; height: 529.66px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Sara gave her a postcard of the temple, as we had been challenged to do </span><span>in district</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;council.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Monday morning is really windy, and one of a cluster of four palm trees actually blew over overnight. Bruce attended a meeting with Phil Windley&#39;s capstone class. By the time he went outside the fallen tree had been removed by landscape staff.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 529.50px; height: 314.81px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 529.50px; height: 314.81px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Empty space second from left (see inset) and you can see bark left by fallen trunk on sidewalk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Sara has a short video on her phone &mdash; showing the fallen trunk at the very beginning and end &mdash; that pans around showing the wind (that we don&#39;t know how to embed). Bruce went out to help some sisters wash their car but they didn&#39;t end up showing up, and so he drove to the stake center where everyone in the zone was gathered and where the cars had been washed. He delivered a package and two letters but completely forgot to deliver an item to the mission president. Later, Sara made pot pies from a delicious chicken stew, and they were good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Tuesday we slept in until we were awakened by a rude tele-marketing call. We attended the last district council of this transfer at the stake center, after which a visiting elder (EH) took a picture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 358.79px; height: 229.79px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 358.79px; height: 229.79px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Elders Kim, Fehoko, Kam, Frogley, Olson; Sisters Krupp, Boehme, Sorensen, Paez; Us</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Sara left just before the training and went to pick up pizzas, which we shared with them after the meeting and picture.

Bruce got some additional books to read and we returned home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Wednesday, we awoke to a rather cold morning (64&deg;F at sunrise) and one of us spent some time near the oven in the kitchen to warm up. Bruce worked on this document and read, while Sara slept to make up for some late night conversations with her children. Laundry day. We got a phone call from Elder Hollingsworth giving Sara a contact person to call tomorrow at 8:30am. Bruce lost badly on the weekly puzzles, not even finishing the Sudoku and getting -32 on the crossword puzzle compared to Sara&#39;s -11. Sara is the winner!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Thursday morning, Sara was able to talk with someone at Ensign College about an equivalent course for her degree; we are hopeful. During that, Bruce got a call from Lethbridge about his missing Canadian dollar retirement check, which they will ask to be re-issued. We went to a movie and then picked up some food at Jack in the Box. We went to the stake center for the ward study class and to host the family history center. Came home and Bruce attended the evening transfer zoom meeting, while Sara retired for the night with a very sore knee.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Friday we got a phone call from Ben telling us that the county is taking out the trees south of the Price house, claiming that they are not on the lot, but on the right-of-way. Breakfast and SkipBo game. Trying to access a hearing for Tiffany; we learned that her parole hearing yesterday was a success and apparently she will be released in a month. Shopping at Safeway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Saturday we enjoyed another cool morning, and rainy day. We had a visit from the sister missionaries, and saw a set of elders at our ward&#39;s movie night.</span></p></body></html>
