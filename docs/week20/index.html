We arrived early for the choir rehearsal before the stake conference session, at 9am, and worked through the choir numbers, </span><span class="c2">We Thank Thee Oh God For a Prophet</span><span>, and </span><span class="c2">Our Prayer to Thee</span><span>. The conference itself was great. We understand that it can be </span><span class="c3"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D2_uDfaBjm4w&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1762663210088257&amp;usg=AOvVaw1lfJHreLYbpSkvw0ZOo0D8">found on YouTube</a></span><span class="c0">. After the meeting we left abruptly, and Bruce brought the car to the front exit while Sara returned a white sweater to Sister Chun, who had given the sweater off her back when we realized that Sara was supposed to be wearing white but had on her blue sweater. We arrived in Honolulu at the tabernacle just after 12:30pm for a lesson that the missionaries, Elders Russell and Schmidt, were giving Danny and Denise about the sacrament. Danny was recently ordained a deacon and will be passing the sacrament for the first time in a couple of weeks. This lesson was given in the main chapel, right by the sacrament table. We then retired to a classroom and gave Denise a blessing so that she can be healed from her health problems. We realized that we had actually met Elder Russell &nbsp;for the first time in the MTC; when walking between classes we would greet missionaries and ask where they were going and where they were from, etc. After all of this, we gave them a ride home, stopping to eat at the main Zippy&#39;s on King Street.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 501.47px; height: 433.13px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 501.47px; height: 433.13px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In which we see that Bruce also can get caught up in the mechanics of taking a selfie. We got home with just an hour or two to nap before the choir rehearsal at 6pm. This is for a program which the stake is preparing for November 22nd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday, we got up early and arrived to pick up Denise for medical appointments, so we had to leave home right after sunrise at about 6:30am. We dropped her off, and then had breakfast at MacDonald&#39;s and drove to the Costco in Waipio to get gas and shop for groceries. Afterward we had a bit of time left, so we drove to a Jollibee in Waipahu, but they didn&#39;t have the specialty item we were looking for. Sara did some shopping in the Seafood City Supermarket while Bruce waited in the car to keep the air conditioning going so the frozen food would thaw less quickly. Denise phoned that she was done just as Sara got back to the car with her purchases. We drove about twenty-four minutes to pick her up and take her home. We got back to Kaneohe about 1pm, so that was a long morning. After a nap, we met Justin Okamura at the stake center where he captured a talk that we were asked to prepare for the Castle Dale stake conference to be held next weekend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Tuesday, we are fasting with the young missionaries for some miracles. Bruce was up just after sunrise to write these words on the deck and enjoyed the perfect weather and palm trees. He likes palm trees because wherever they grow is a place that never sees snow. He often says that when he became conscious (in Canada at an early age), he realized that a terrible mistake had been made, and he has been moving south ever since. Between Mauritius ten years ago and now, he has arrived. </span><span>District</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;council meeting was just wonderful. It is so great to be in the presence of these young missionaries who bring the spirit with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday we went to the temple and participated in a sealing session at 9am. Then we stopped at Temple Beach. The water was a little too rough for our liking, but we got our salt water fix.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 450.91px; height: 338.69px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 450.91px; height: 338.69px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And Bruce enjoyed a fresh coconut on the way home; Sara also enjoyed a sip of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 587.19px; height: 805.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 587.19px; height: 805.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday we got some things done after breakfast, including sending off the monthly rent check. We are about to join the SYS zoom meeting. It was wonderful. Our president spoke of a recent meeting where Elder Bednar (who had set them apart) opened up a new way of seeing section 107 about the organization of the church. We went to the library and the food court for lunch, along with filling a prescription and turning in some cans and bottles at recycling for a dollar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Friday, we are preparing for a set of elders to join us for dinner. So, we went to </span><span>shop the</span><span>&nbsp;bargains at</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Safeway, but remembered that we had some ribs in the freezer. Those are in the oven now and we are cleaning up the dining area for the event. It was a very nice visit with Elder Tesoro and Elder Cannon. The former gave us a blessing in his closing prayer which we really appreciated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Saturday, we met Jasmin at the elders apartment and had him look at it (to give us a cleaning bid). Sara took fifty pictures and will be creating a document around them. We treated him afterwards at the Coral Kingdom restaurant, enjoying their </span><span class="c2">huli</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">huli</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;chicken. </span></p><p class="c10"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 448.50px; height: 474.59px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 448.50px; height: 474.59px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now we are at home (where it is over 80&deg;) working on transforming the pictures into a report for the mission housing coordinators. Both Word (which Sara can do pretty things with) and Google Docs (which Bruce prefers) were giving us a hard time, so Bruce wrote a bit of code to produce a little (hundred and fifty megabyte) web page from which Sara could drag pictures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We got word at 4:44pm that our testimony had been shown in the Castle Dale stake conference; in a text message from our bishop, Bishop Hughes, said, &quot;Oh how wonderful to see and hear your testimony in stake conference. We just watched it and it definitely brought the spirit.&quot; Which was all that we had hoped for. This has thus been a week bracketed by stake conferences.</span></p></body></html>
