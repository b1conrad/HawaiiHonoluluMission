We drove the Scion to church. Bruce was asked to give the invocation in sacrament meeting. During the passing of the water, Sara realized that she was getting a UTI and so we left as the priesthood brethren returned to their families. Bruce returned to the meeting and after it asked Brother (soon to be Elder) Chun to come back with him to anoint and assist in blessing Sara, which he did. She received a powerful blessing, and drank some </span><span class="c4">bois de rhone</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and had Bruce pick her up some Azo at a pharmacy after Sunday School. She is better now. Elder Peterson thoughtfully texted us the address of the chapel where we will have our zone conference tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Monday saw us traveling to Mililani. The zone conference was great. We were early after a couple of stops in Honolulu, so we did some grocery shopping at Safeway and arrived in time. Good thing we checked because suit coats were </span><span class="c4">de rigeur</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and Bruce brought his. Lunch was sandwiches and chips so it was good that Sara had bought some yogurt and boiled eggs to eat. </span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mission leaders seated center; Bruce and Sara are the second couple from the right side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Young missionaries stayed with the mission leaders to play a jeopardy-like game, the Mililani Zone against the Kaneohe Zone. We left to shop for fruit, eggs, and chicken at Costco. Home to an apartment solar-heated to 81&deg;! Second lunch and resting. Scripture study, preparing for talks on Sunday, and reviewing these weekly histories.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Tuesday was our zone&#39;s day at the temple, so Bruce drove us to Laie and back. Lunch was </span><span class="c4 c6"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loco_moco&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1754849959146533&amp;usg=AOvVaw02F7WAUWfq2IwuQ5Ja41ty">loco moco</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at He&rsquo;eia Pier General Store &amp; Deli, which wasn&#39;t as good as we had hoped. Bruce spoke with Jasmin about diagnosing our A/C problems and gave him a key to the car. Rested and played SkipBo a bit. The hot plate for the sisters arrived from Amazon and we texted them and let the housing coordinator know. Jasmin (with a tiny amount of help from Bruce) diagnosed the A/C and found two problems. First, the control for the blower needs to be replaced as it doesn&#39;t consistently run the fan (about $30 for the part). Secondly, the A/C compressor is shot and needs to be replaced (between $100 and $200 for the part), and that replacement will involve removing the serpentine belt, etc. So about four hours for that and a couple of hours to get to the blower switch. He and Bruce will meet on Saturday to go buy the parts and then he will do the work for us. Phone calls from Eli, Jessica, and Aunt Janis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday, we drove into Honolulu for a couple of errands early in the morning, then back to Kaneohe for district council. We were a little early so we drove around a neighborhood near the chapel hoping for a glimpse of the bay. Sara played for the opening hymn, Redeemer of Israel, and Bruce was asked to give the opening prayer. The meeting went really well, with reporting key indicators, role playing initial contact, and a training given by sisters Anderson and Mobil. We gave the cook top to sisters Miner and Jones. We came home to rest a bit, and Bruce talked with Aaron about parking. We need to move the truck during the day Friday. We went to a farmers market held inside the mall and bought some lychees. Came home to prepare dinner for the sisters. We had a wonderful visit with them, and they brought the spirit of the Lord with them. We enjoyed a salad and a rice-chicken-mushroom stew and an a&ccedil;ai bowl. They invited us to, at the end of the day, identify a spiritual moment and write it down. For us, it was their visit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday, we drove very early to Honolulu for an appointment. Ran into a member and had a great conversation with her. Got back to Kaneohe just a little bit late for the repairmen, who patched the spot on the ceiling and installed a grab bar in our tub. Phone calls. Sara attended an ice cream social with the ward Relief Society, and Bruce enjoyed conversation with a couple of brothers in the hallway. Went to Ross to price nightwear. Home after dark for the first time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday we parked the truck on Emepela Place in a convenient spot for overnight. We got a message to help a single mother and gathered information and are waiting for callbacks to see how we can help. Did some banking, preparatory for getting work done on the car tomorrow, and drove to an appointment in a neighboring area, Ahuimanu, with a part-member couple, in the third ward, with sisters Anderson and Mobil. Ate at Panda Express, then bought a gallon of milk at Safeway, where we ran into two couples from Laie.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday, we awoke early, waiting for Jasmin, who came at about ten thirty. We drove to the parts store and bought a blower resistor, then to his house where he replaced it. He checked the relay and fixed it. The blower motor was bad, so we drove to Kailua and bought a replacement for $99, some Freon, and a cabin filter. I bought us lunch at Oneawa Market, which we took back to his house to eat. His landlord had taken &quot;our&quot; spot in the driveway to wash his car. After the landlord finished washing his car, Jasmin recharged the Freon in the Scion and replaced the blower motor. A/C works! In all, we paid $212 for parts and lunch and $250 for labor. While Bruce was off doing that, Sara wrote her talk. Sisters Anderson and Mobil stopped by to bake cookies. After they left, Sara ran through her talk in seven minutes. We received confirmation of an appointment at the Manoa ward for noon tomorrow, with Brother Anderson, a counselor in the bishopric it turned out. We&#39;re hopeful that they can assist the single mother.</span></p></body></html>
