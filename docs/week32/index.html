In the sacrament meeting there were good speakers including Moheni, who will be flying over to the mainland MTC tomorrow. Sad to see him go, but he will do a great mission. The second hour was okay, with lots of participation in the discussion. We came home for lunch (picking up buffalo wings that Helaman had ordered on the way) and naps. Bruce and Helaman had a good talk. We then drove down to the Olomana Ward in Waimanalo for Carl&#39;s baptism (after sunset).</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 609.39px; height: 569.30px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 609.39px; height: 569.30px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Brother Kaui (who baptized), Carl, Elders Hess and Hilson.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">His mother had spoken in the stake missionary fireside two weeks before. They served rice and chili afterwards, which hit the spot. We were happy to see our friend from the local Safeway store there, and it was fun to meet a family whose mother is from the Provo area and expecting their fourth child, as we shared a table with them while eating.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Monday morning, Bruce got up for a zoom meeting with Phil&#39;s students at 8am. After that we drove to the stake center and continued working on pathways, culminating in Sara being accepted as a student. Then we drove to Safeway to buy food for a movie-watching party with the young missionaries in our district, stopping at home to pick up our TV and remote control. We got to the chapel </span><span>on Waikalua</span><span>&nbsp;about 15 minutes early. It was fun to watch Johnny Lingo with them and feed them chicken and salads. While we were away, our dehumidifier had been broken for a time and water was dripping from our downstairs neighbor&#39;s ceiling. Aaron came in and found the problem. We unplugged it and </span><span>plan</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to return it to Costco on Thursday, so Bruce carried the heavy thing down to the car.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Tuesday we slept quite late, still getting </span><span>to district</span><span>&nbsp;council shortly after it began at 10am. Good reports were made, and the sisters did a great job training us in </span><span class="c7">Twice in White</span><span>&nbsp;&mdash;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the hashtag to celebrate new members going to the temple. After the meeting we followed the four elders to their apartment in the north, and helped them clean it out of many things that had accumulated over the years. They have a nice and closer view of the mountain above Kualoa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 352.30px; height: 468.39px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 352.30px; height: 468.39px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bruce wrote a letter to the housing coordinators explaining their needs, and reporting on the combined twenty person-hours of cleaning/de-junking work! We made it to bed by 7:50pm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wednesday is a good morning. Bruce found the receipt for the dehumidifier, so we are preparing to take the broken one back to Costco. They accepted it with no problem and we bought a replacement along with needed groceries. Bruce had nice talks with Elizabeth and Helaman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thursday came. Preparing for the SYS zoom call and taking Denise on an errand. It ended up being a long day with a lot of driving around. At lunch (at Betty&#39;s Burgers) while sitting on their patio, a woman stopped and said hello (because of our badges); it turns out that she is a member of Denise&#39;s ward, and we had a nice long talk with Maydell. We dropped into the mission office to pick up some materials, and to introduce Denise to some of the senior couples, one of whom goes to her ward. We learned that the housing coordinators are delivering the new bed frames today. We picked up her son at his school and then dropped them off for a medical appointment downtown (and had some trouble getting out of it and onto the Like Like highway). We stopped (for our first time) at the Kamehameha shopping center just at the edge of town to get a snack, and ran into our bishop, who was running some errands there. Home at 3:30pm. Naps. Bruce went alone to the evening class at the stake center because Sara had a bad headache. But it wasn&#39;t so bad that she couldn&#39;t host the family history area, which she did well, helping a member and his son with their research. We learned that we may be asked to help the youth find names to take to the temple on their next trip to do baptisms there in March.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Friday, Bruce got up and sat on the deck to watch the sunrise, which was pretty tame, the skies being overcast today. He was able to help Phil a little bit with the Capstone project he has going this semester. Bruce visited Destinn, who is still suffering from a pinched nerve, and picked up the bottle of Topricin &mdash; sadly, the company that made it has gone out of business and we have been unable to order a replacement. Long and spirited talk with Helaman. Too tired to go out after dark, so we just retired for the night (and thus missed the baptism of Loyal).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Saturday came and Bruce went to spend a half hour vacuuming part of the chapel, then home for a shower, breakfast, and a brief nap before we both headed back there for Aaliyah&#39;s baptism.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 240.50px; height: 266.66px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 240.50px; height: 266.66px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span>She and her father had sat behind us a couple of months ago in sacrament meeting, and Sara invited her to come </span><span>to Relief</span><span>&nbsp;Society and Bruce invited him </span><span>to Priesthood</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;meeting. After a bit of a laugh, she went to meet with the young women, who took her into their hearts. She is shown above with Elder Kim and Elder Olson. She was baptized by our bishop and her father gave the closing prayer at the service. There were many relatives, some of whom had come long distances, and it was a moving experience. The water level was too low (there is a leak maybe), and so we had to wait while the bishop added more water. When she came up she let out a loud little scream; apparently the water was very cold. After a long conversation with Helaman (while Sara talked with Daniel on the phone), we attended the zoom meeting about the next transfer. We are still waiting for the actual transfer news&hellip; </span></p></body></html>
