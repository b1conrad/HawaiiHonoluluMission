In the foyer, Bruce met Jung Oh, who collaborates with Jacob Siebach in BYU Hawaii&#39;s IT group when Jacob comes here. Brother Oh is the high council representative to the Kaneohe 4th ward which we&#39;ve been attending (at 9:30am). Pippin and Ozzie arrived and she bore her testimony which was very cute. Bruce asked if anyone had a large used white shirt for Danny to wear, and sister Wright volunteered to buy one for him! Just have to get the measurements. We left after the first hour to visit DLB who had a painful ear that had kept him from sleeping. Sara showed him Bowen Work moves to help, and we left him some BF&amp;C for his bruises. Then we drove to the Manoa ward building (got there at 11:40am, with that ward in classes) to meet up with Denise and Danny, the latter of whom we learned bore a testimony near the end of their meeting. They had met with the elders yesterday and with the Bishop today. Bruce met JT of the Sunday school presidency, who had served a mission in Japan, whose daughter has been called there, and whose nephew will soon be in this mission. He knew Mindy Colin in California and at BYU, and so had heard about Mauritius. We drove D&amp;D to drop off a rent check and then took them to their home. We got home to rest up a bit at 2:59pm before going out to give a healing blessing at 4:30pm. It was quite moving, and we learned later that she was better in a couple of days.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Monday, beginning to plan a small luncheon for Thursday. Sara made many phone calls after taking a bath. Planning to have sisters visit for dinner and printing some training materials. Texting various people, learning some good news about some, and wishing others well. Sisters Miner and Jones had dinner with us, left us a message about establishing a house of order, like our home can be like a temple, and we did a little printing for them. Bruce had learned how to do this because of a calling we received in Orangeville first ward after starting our mission papers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tuesday we got up early for an appointment at 7:30 in Honolulu. We drove to Sam&#39;s Club in Pearl City to get a membership card. The web shows it opens at 10am but just before nine it was open and bustling, and it turns out that it opens two hours earlier for plus members, and we could have waited until 10am to check out. So we drove up the hill to Walmart and did the shopping we needed (except for strawberries which were too expensive) for the luncheon, and then drove to Kaneohe. Along the way we were delayed by some kind of police operation on Moanalua Road with dozens of motorcycles, so we detoured on Ho&#39;omalu Street. As a result, we arrived a bit late for the district council meeting, which was very well conducted. Then home for naps. We received some unfortunate, but not entirely unexpected, news. We also committed to have four elders over for dinner tomorrow night.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wednesday, Bruce wrote and mailed the monthly check for mission expenses. We received phone calls from Eli, Jessica, and Janis. And a text message from Marc Colin. In the afternoon we went shopping at Safeway. At the checkout there was a problem with the price of a package of uncooked shrimp. While that was being sorted we turned to the man and boy behind us as if to apologize. He wasn&rsquo;t bothered, looked at our name tags and asked, &ldquo;Joe Smith?&rdquo; He wants to talk with the elders, although he said looking us over that he should go to the top (meaning older people we suppose). We invited him to dinner but he had to get home to Aiea; he just works in Kaneohe. We passed his contact information to the mission secretary. Back home, Bruce shucked six corn cobs on the front (and only) porch and set the table while Sara worked over a hot stove. The elders arrived, Fowles, Peterson, Fowler and McElroy, and we enjoyed a meal and conversation. Where we are from, our family size and position, why we decided to serve a mission, etc. Bruce was able to tell the story he told in his talk a couple of Sundays ago, and we told the story of meeting Elders Fowles and Ames on March 12. They left us with a message about the plan of happiness and invited us to acknowledge the Lord&#39;s hand in our lives by looking for something every day and writing it down.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Thursday, we woke up (of course, thank the Lord), and began to get ready for interviews. Bruce was reminded of Proverbs 3:5-6 that had been quoted last Sunday in a testimony, and felt the calm assurance from the spirit that we are where the Lord wants us to be.Working hard to prepare luncheon, and watching SYS and listening at times because our Internet was unreliable. Found out the interview schedule (it is the mission president who interviews all of the young elders and sisters in our zone, while we merely provide his lunch), and we&#39;ll go to the chapel to begin setting up at 11:30am. We had a good time visiting with the Larsons as we set up tables and chairs and set out the salad fixings we&#39;d prepared and they set out the croissants. Everyone realized we didn&#39;t have table cloths, so Sara drove back to our apartment to get some that had been left by the Mundells. When the president came in, Bruce greeted him in French, which was fun and they spoke together a bit in French. He had worked there several years (for Air Liquide) in offices on the Quai d&#39;Orsay in Paris. He called on Sister Larson for the blessing and we sat down together and enjoyed the meal and conversation. We learned that the Kauai stake conference has been postponed until September. Afterwards, we cleaned up and put everything back and came home for naps. Phone calls from Eli, Jessica, and finally from Helaman. Sara made a delicious chicken broccoli casserole for dinner.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Friday looks like it will be a day of shopping and appointments. Trying with limited success to get some help, parking at the cathedral ($8! for one hour) and walking to a couple of office buildings. Will phone again on Monday at 11:30am. We then drove to Costco for groceries and hot dog lunch, then home to put away food and fill out medical forms before heading back to Honolulu to meet Dr. Sharon Lawler. Lots more forms to fill with a physician helper. Now waiting in the examination room. Great conversation with the doctor, who prescribed some things, then had a blood draw taken and we waited for the results and conferred again. We drove back to Kaneohe and shopped at Safeway, where we had trouble with the app and learned that we can only clip a digital coupon one time per week.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Saturday, we got up intending to go to the swap meet, but we decided to drive all the way to the end of Waikalua Road to check out the waterfront there. We had a very interesting conversation with a member family with five sons, the oldest of whom (not present) will be on a mission in Florida soon, and the father of whom had served in Nebraska. The mother of the family is the sister of our ward&#39;s mission leader (which thing neither parent present knew). We also had a long talk with the navy wife of another family there. She is from Virginia. We learned that they purchased a thousand square foot two bed two bathroom house for nearly $7 </span><span class="c1">lakh</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and plan to sell it when they get their next orders (they would rent but don&#39;t want to deal remotely with a rogue HOA). We walked up a little hill into the shade of a beautiful tree, surrounded by wild chickens and had a phone conversation with Eli and with DLB who is feeling much better.</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 517.13px; height: 689.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 517.13px; height: 689.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The beach itself is dirt rather than sand, and the water is shallow a long way out, but we&#39;ll probably come and try it. We drove to breakfast at Pan&#39;s Kitchen, then on to the swap meet near the stadium, which we learned is going to be torn down soon. We found a few bargains and had a good time in spite of the crowds and the heat.</span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 291.96px; height: 390.62px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 291.96px; height: 390.62px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 292.16px; height: 390.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 292.16px; height: 390.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 285.91px; height: 383.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 285.91px; height: 383.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We got home and put everything away and enjoyed a nap, from which we were awakened by the roar of aircraft overhead. Today is the Kaneohe air show, and it was the Blue Angels. Bruce sat on the porch for a while observing the jets flying in formation in the distance. We enjoyed a good meal, and are ready to retire for the evening. And that wraps the week.</span></p></body></html>
