We are to pick up the keys from her, along with the oven racks, and a written checklist for the cleanup. Sacrament meeting was good, as was the following priesthood meeting. The missionary huddle afterwards went on for a long time, and then Bruce gave Elder Olson his package that had been delivered last week and went home to publish last week&#39;s blog post. Nap. Then, the highlight of the day was Sara&#39;s return, when Bruce got her at the airport.</span></p><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 304.75px; height: 400.30px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 304.75px; height: 400.30px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday morning, after a good night&#39;s sleep, Sara cleaned out the fridge and freezer. After breakfast, she had a long talk with Helaman. Bruce sadly removed one of his temperature sensors (the one in the shed) from use because it stopped working yesterday afternoon. Long phone call from Melanie. We decided to visit the Family History center this morning; Sara worked on her on-line course, and Bruce did some family history work (including finding an ancestor named Bridget (about which he sent an email message to Elizabeth)). Helaman and Sara worked on ordering some food delivery by Amazon from Whole Foods as an experiment. One set of sisters asked us about incoming packages, and Bruce went out to check, but none had come. He read on the chair on our porch for a while.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday we enjoyed sleeping in a little bit. Elder Crosbie, the district leader, wants us to pick him up fifteen minutes earlier than usual, so that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do. We had a good district council meeting. Afterwards, we ate the donuts we drove him to get, and took a district photo. </span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 314.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 314.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back: Sisters Sorensen, Pugh (Molokai), Haycock (Kauai), Krupp; Sara and Bruce. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Front: Elders Kam, Olson, Hirschi (Kauai), Crosbie (Maui), Tesoro (Hawaii), and Cannon (Maui).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the pulpit, you can see the gingerbread house that they made on P-day and gave to us.</span></p><p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 379.20px; height: 366.16px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 379.20px; height: 366.16px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the evening, we drove to the family history library to work on homework again. Work on weekly puzzles in bed; Bruce was faster in sudoku, but gave up on the crossword puzzle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday dawned rainy and overcast. After breakfast, heading out to inspect missionary cars. Bruce returned a book to the library. Sara fiddled with the refrigerator, which isn&#39;t keeping cool enough. Both went to the Family History Library in the evening. We turned the power back on the fridge and it seems to be cooling better; fingers crossed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday, we left early to drive Denise to a place in Kapolei where they gave her a laptop computer. Then we took her to lunch at Denny&#39;s, and then shopped briefly at Costco. While there, we met the Wolthuis couple and two of their students from Laie; he is the program lead for CIS at BYUH and seemed interested in getting Bruce to teach there after our mission. We drove Denise home, Bruce carrying a box of groceries up to her apartment door. Home for naps. In the evening, we participated in the transfer zoom call at 9pm and met virtually the new missionaries in our zone and district. Unusually, the mission leaders participated in that breakout session. Bruce stayed up until after midnight talking with Helaman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Friday, we drove to the Costco in Hawaii Kai to have lunch with Daniel and his son. Daniel said that in his reading he learned that he needs to be baptized; he kept emphasizing the word </span><span class="c9">need</span><span>&nbsp;and asked us why we hadn&#39;t told him it was necessary. We arrived a little early to the doctor&#39;s office, but went right </span><span>in to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the lab for Sara&#39;s blood draw. While there, we ran into Sister Gedeon, who talked with us for quite awhile about her problems, and asked us to pray with her, which we did in a corner of the waiting area. The doctor said Sara&#39;s A1C went down but is still too high, and asked her to try Munjaro, giving us a sample pack for four weeks. Strangely, her hematocrit was too high (after years and years of it being too low). We drove home and Bruce napped while Sara prepared rice for our contribution of lechon. Bruce drove over to the stake center and Sister Lee&#39;s house to pick up the keys and oven racks. While there, Helaman called to say that Bruce had taken Sara&#39;s phone with him and that she was ready, so he went and got her. The evening was fun, though with fewer people than usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 503.45px; height: 278.90px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 503.45px; height: 278.90px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Conrad, Chun, Vogelsberg, Larson, Jones, Andersen, Andersen, Peterson, Lelegrand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The photograph was taken by the daughter of the Vogelsbergs. Also in attendance </span><span>was the Larson&#39;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;grandson. This is the first one of these that we&#39;ve attended with the mission leaders (the taller of the Andersens in the picture) joining in, so that was a rare treat. After cleaning up, we came home and watched a movie and then had a good night&#39;s sleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday morning, we got up at 7 and fixed breakfast and put in a load of laundry. Sara has a very bad toothache, and phoned around trying to find a dentist, without success. Bruce went and bought her Tylenol which seems to have helped. He then went alone to the ward Christmas party which was a lot of good fun, and the food was good too; he brought home a plate for her. We received a lovely Christmas card in the mail from Colleen and LeRon.</span></p></body></html>
