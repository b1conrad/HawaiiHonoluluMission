We will be driving to Honolulu to pick up Denise and Danny who want to visit our ward this week. And this year, our ward will be meeting at 11:30am (two hours later than last year), so we didn&#39;t have to get up as early as before. Today is a rainy day, forecast for all </span><span>day. We</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;set out at 9:45am and got to their apartment at 10:13am and then we drove them to our ward in Kaneohe. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">To drive a car, you have to have a place for it to park. We have two cars, but only one parking space, so the truck had been parked in the street, but got a ticket. So we got a guest parking pass for it, so it can stay overnight in a visitor spot, and then we parked the car in the primo spot shown below. This is the spot where the truck had been parked for many weeks.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 409.50px; height: 286.13px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 409.50px; height: 286.13px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Last week, the truck got ticketed because its safety inspection is out of date (9/25). Shown here, along with the guest parking pass (for when we will&#39;ve forgotten what it looks like).</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 352.11px; height: 177.08px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 352.11px; height: 177.08px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Anyway, we lost the good spot because Bruce wanted to take the car so that our passengers would be more comfortable. The fast and testimony meeting was great, and so was the second hour. Bruce also met WIlliam Klein, who is waiting for a mission call and came to our ward from Laie because he was in the area. He, Bruce, and Dennis gave Denise a blessing and then we took D&amp;D to eat and then home. We picked up a couple of prescriptions when we got back home. The elders came and picked up the packages that had arrived before we left in the first place. We got the good parking spot back for the car (and took the picture above).</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Monday, Bruce was awakened by a phone call from Matt Greene (at 7:30am), who, when he realized we were in a different time zone, apologized. They had a much-appreciated conversation about Sara&#39;s academic program (including </span><span class="c4"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B3YKe7AcHPMMR8dh9matCYu4lgxxG69OdqrSOsW09kY/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1768119896829332&amp;usg=AOvVaw1TMqw3QPAHe6NPH9ILESqN">concerns about the textbook</a></span><span class="c2">), which will need some follow-up. After breakfast, we set out to do two things: study at the family history center in the stake center, and run some errands in Kailua. Of the hour we had for the former activity we spent the first half talking with Viviane Owens (and we learned a lot) and the second working on Sara&#39;s class (until her computer ran out of power (we had neglected to bring the power cord)). We were able to speak with Jasmin briefly as we drove out of Haiku Point; he had just returned from his older sister&#39;s funeral service in Iowa. </span></p><p class="c3"><span>Kailua, the neighboring city, isn&#39;t as close as it seems (city centers are 4.6 miles apart (by comparison, the city centers of Provo and Orem are 4.9 miles apart)) and does share a common boundary with Kaneohe. Our goals were: sell back empty bottles and cans; return two things to Amazon (at Whole Foods); eat lunch; return books to library (the Kaneohe library is closed for a month); get some new books from the library; and do some banking (the Kailua branch is more pleasant). We accomplished all but the first of these (the recycle center was (subjectively) </span><span class="c9">too busy</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;each time we passed it). Packages were delivered to us for both Elders Kam and Olson.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Tuesday we are preparing for a temple trip, and will take along the two packages received yesterday, as we expect to see the young missionaries of our district there. On the way home we ate on the back patio of Keneke&#39;s at Punalu&rsquo;u. Not shown are all the farm animals &mdash; fun.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 228.50px; height: 299.97px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 228.50px; height: 299.97px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">This is slightly out of order, but here is the entire district at the temple.</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.50px; height: 462.15px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 602.50px; height: 462.15px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Elders: Olson, Phister (ZL), Kim (DL), Fehoko, Kam, Frogley (ZL), and Conrad</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Sisters: Krupp, Boehme (STL), Paez (STL), Sorensen, and Conrad</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Before the group photo, Bruce walked all around the temple: looking east, then south, then around the south end and to the west side, and while behind the temple first looking east and then west. It is a lovely building in a beautifully landscaped setting.</span></p><p class="c7"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 584.42px; height: 219.16px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 584.42px; height: 219.16px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Once back in Kaneohe, Bruce drove the truck to get a safety inspection, but they don&#39;t allow walk-ins so he just stopped and sold the empty cans and bottles. There was a long line, so he talked to a few people and learned some tricks to get a few more cents out of the deal (we pay a 5&cent; deposit for every full can and bottle we buy, and we like to get it back on the empties (which are valued by weight though and not by count)).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Wednesday is Jessica&#39;s birthday. It will also be the weekly district council meeting, which is generally held on Tuesdays. When Tuesday is the temple day it is offset by one day. We took the packages there, participated in the meeting, and then made an appointment to get the truck safety inspection a week from today at 12:30pm. We printed out some temple cards for the sisters. In the evening we went to the stake center so that Sara could work on her homework; it was rather noisy and not as cool as we would have liked.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Thursday, Bruce got up before sunrise and read on the porch. Then we got ready for the zoom meeting, called </span><span class="c9">SYS</span><span class="c2">, which is mission-wide. Sara spent most of the day working on her finance class, which is daunting and discouraging, mainly because the course is presented in an adversarial posture, combined with the textbook being full of errors and trickery.</span></p><p class="c3"><span>Friday came and we enjoyed the morning. We set out to do four errands and accomplished two of them; some banking and some shopping. The day was very hot and sweaty. </span><span>Hamburger</span><span>&nbsp;was on sale, so we </span><span>browned</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;a couple of pounds to be frozen in baggies for future taco and spaghetti meals.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Saturday, Bruce got up and dressed early enough to help clean the chapel at 7:30am. As we were starting to prepare lunch we got a call from the Mangums telling us that Elders Hess and Hilson were at the Nissan dealership and needed a ride back to their area. So we got in the truck and drove to the car. Then we moved the car and parked the truck to hold the good space and drove to the dealership and picked them up. We waited for them to get what they needed from their apartment near the Kailua chapel and then drove them to their area in Waimanalo. After dropping them off, we drove to a place that took a gift card we had and used it ($25) on a shrimp plate that we shared. Next door is the post office and next to it is another Keneke&#39;s grill, which surprised Bruce because he thought the one in Punalu&#39;u was the only one, but it&#39;s not. We also got a couple of burgers and a soda at McDonald&#39;s on the way back. Arriving at Haiku point, Bruce moved the truck out of the spot and Sara parked the car in it and we drove to our one parking spot (#113) and Bruce backed the truck into it. Sara is working on getting a discounted dinner at the PCC as advertised on Facebook, which apparently is a false advertisement..</span></p></body></html>
