Young sister Vuikadavu gave a great talk on obedience, and Elder Tesoro followed on the same topic, with Bryan Straight concluding. We sat just in front of Dave and Michelle Thornton&mdash;visiting from Colorado&mdash;who are the parents of the husband of Lonna and Max Cropper&#39;s daughter, Karolyn (small-world incident). We were given a nice gift from the Longs, including a couple of avocados from their garden. After the meeting, we said goodbye to Leala who is moving to the big island to be closer to family (nine sisters).</span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 453.50px; height: 398.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 453.50px; height: 398.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At 4pm, we met Jasmin who put up the curtain rods for the sisters&#39; new curtains, which haven&#39;t yet arrived. From there, Sara dropped Bruce off at choir practice, and he caught a ride home from Elder Chun. The latter invited us to join in his planned Thanksgiving meal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Monday was such a beautiful morning that we turned off the air conditioner in the living room and </span><span>ha</span><span>d the door open. It&#39;s supposed to peak at 80&deg; today. We received notice that the curtains and other things being shipped to us for young missionaries are delayed until tomorrow. In the end, a fan for some elders and the curtains for some sisters did arrive today. Bruce assembled the fan, which we will deliver tomorrow when we go </span><span>to district</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;council. We also put together a powerpoint slide with an audio message behind it for our home ward to play at their Christmas party; we&#39;ll find out tomorrow if it works for them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday, we awoke to a phone call from Ben, talking about his recent land purchase. We picked up Elders Crosbie and Kam, who are on bicycles, and delivered the fan to them, and then took them to the chapel to prepare for district council. It was a good meeting. The sisters took away their curtains and a utensil tray that we got for them. We were hungry and so stopped for lunch of tacos (for Sara) and pizza (for Bruce) then took the pizza home to share with Helaman. There were packages on our doorstep: another fan, a package for Elder Crosbie, and another in the mailbox for Sister Haycock. We delivered the two latter ones on our way to Honolulu. We left some clothes (a shirt, tie, and pants for Danny (donated by the Frosts)) on Denise&#39;s doorstep (she is ill today). Then we drove downtown to pay a couple of bills, and then on to Costco in Waipio, where we bought gas and groceries. We got home via H3 before dark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday, we got to the temple at 9:07am for an appointment, then drove back home, buying a coconut, bananas, and a papaya on the way. We got some difficult news. Bruce picked up a library book and did some shopping: a broom for one set of elders and a flexible spatula for another set.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday morning came with some laughter, which was a welcome change from yesterday. Bruce will have a Hancock cousins chat at 7am, and then we&#39;ll have a day of zone conference. </span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 346.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 346.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Two of his cousins, Ron, and Darrel, recently lost grandchildren in their early twenties &mdash; so sad.

Bruce found the two sisters who serve in Hawaii Kai, to whom we introduced Daniel by phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 310.50px; height: 325.77px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 310.50px; height: 325.77px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sisters Hardy and Jarman at the meal at the end of zone conference.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 185.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 185.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Later in the day, Daniel came to talk to us in person, along with his daughter. We were able to lend them a blowup mattress and Sara gave her a dress so that she could feel comfortable at church on Sunday. Bruce invited them to attend the open house and concert on Saturday, and they plan to do so. We let the sisters know and they arranged permission to attend also in order to meet them there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Friday morning was rainy and Bruce spent a while on the front porch, working on a history of our various meetings with Daniel. After breakfast, we received a bit of freeing news and also some very bad news. We drove to the airport and bought four pounds of </span><span class="c10">lechon</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from a food truck. It was/is very tasty. Naps ensued. Sara dropped Bruce off at the church for the final rehearsal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Saturday night was the </span><span class="c7"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SOMMDpl8kZe0RoWgthPhm8XXGv-nsesOdr6ehNn5VEk/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1764039953438732&amp;usg=AOvVaw0QcD6KjbVu-yToT_H0A-Yo">open house and concert</a></span><span class="c0">, which was very good. We have a dozen or so video selections from it, which we&#39;ll have to figure out how to deal with here. We were disappointed that Daniel was unable to attend, but he gave us enough notice that we could let the sisters know. We got home and fell into bed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 363.83px; height: 584.41px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 363.83px; height: 584.41px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p></body></html>
