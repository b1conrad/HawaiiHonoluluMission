The meetings were great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 438.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 438.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sara threw together a dinner of ribs, salad, broccoli, and fruit with some help from Kerry, and Reece helped Bruce unbox and install our new dehumidifier. We all drove them back to their hotel and then napped and read until going to bed at 10pm, making it a nice long day. We enjoyed visiting with Bruce&#39;s youngest cousin, in spite of the cold and rain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday morning, Bruce got up early to attend a zoom meeting with Phil&#39;s students. He had expected it to be at 7am, but it was postponed one hour. He also sent off our monthly rent check and ordered more blank checks. We attended the district council meeting at 10am, and then later, Gordon&#39;s baptism at 6pm. Between those, we drove to Waipio to purchase gas, lunch, and fruit and produce for the salads Sara will be building tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 377.59px; height: 201.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.jpg" style="width: 377.59px; height: 201.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Kimo (who baptized), Gordon, Sisters Krupp and Boehme</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 194.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 194.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Most of those who were in attendance.

He left at 6:20am to go pick up his cousins and drove them back to Kaneohe where we picked Sara up on Kahekili highway (she had walked towards us to save time (and we arrived at the temple at 8:30 on the dot)). </span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 520.65px; height: 269.85px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 520.65px; height: 269.85px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elders Walker, Kim, Fehoke, Frogley, Kam, Quiner, Miller, Niualiku; Sisters Krupp and Boehme</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reece, Kerry, Sara, and Bruce attended the session with our district</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We stopped for some fresh fruit, coconut, and sugar cane juice, then we dropped Sara off and Bruce drove them to their hotel. Sara worked on the salads while Bruce napped; then we both worked on the salads; then we drove a bunch of it to the nearby chapel to refrigerate stuff that wouldn&#39;t fit in ours at home. Bruce finished both puzzles first this week, but we are very tired and might get to sleep finally after 10:30pm. Another long day. Sara got a better score on the crossword puzzle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday morning, we awoke before the alarm, ate breakfast, and Sara got ready to go with Helaman to see the doctor. She&#39;s been worried about her left knee. Bruce ran a few errands and then started loading up the car; he was able to leave at 11:27am fully loaded, and got to the tabernacle at 12:02, in time to unload everything into the kitchen, with some help from Elder Larsen. Then, Kerry and Reece pitched in and assembled first the salad, which expanded to fit two containers, and then the fruit salad in a nice bowl borrowed from the stake center. A collage of candid shots shows the sisters and then the elders loading up their plates from the heavily laden tables, first with spaghetti (cooked by the Larsens), warm sliced bread, Sara&#39;s salads, and water. Also shown in insets are Kerry&#39;s hands building up the two kinds of salad, and a trio of sisters talking; it was lovely to see many of the missionaries whom we had gotten to know here in Kaneohe, before they were dispersed across the isles of the mission.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 373.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 373.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After those attending the meeting filled their plates, we who prepared it also ate. Then we cleaned up the kitchen, with Kerry and Reece doing a lot of the work. The Larsens and Bruce were assisted by Elder and Sister Jones in preparing, serving, and cleaning afterwards. Bruce dropped his cousins at Costco and drove home. He and Sara drove to the pharmacy and picked up one prescription, then to dominos to pick up pizzas. It was a long day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Thursday morning we made breakfast, napped, and then attended the SYS meeting on zoom, broadcast from a zone conference </span><span>on island</span><span class="c1">. Then, Sara made a bunch of phone calls to sort through some issues with the prescriptions. WIth that sorted out, we drove back to the pharmacy, where we divided and conquered, as Bruce picked up two prescriptions for Helaman, while Sara ordered lunch at her favorite shop in the food court. After lunch, we napped again, and are now preparing for our evening shift at the family history center, enjoying helping some young men. A package had come for Elder Kim, and Bruce had notified him (not all mail received is talked about here, but Bruce wanted to mention this one), and delivered it at church. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday we launched the self-cleaning task of the oven because it required that it be done; Sara had done some baking of casseroles in the middle of the night. We are preparing to go to a hospital for some tests on her left knee. The power went off at about 9:45am and, unlike many previous outages, it didn&#39;t come back on almost immediately. It was still off when we left at about 10:30am. We found the hospital without difficulties, guided by Bruce&#39;s phone&#39;s map app. After parking in the structure, we got Sara admitted, while Bruce arranged for parking validation. Then Sara had an ultrasound for her knee, followed by an x-ray thereof. We then drove straight to Craig&#39;s office, and Sara purchased two tacos while Bruce walked to the bank (turned out to be the main branch) to get some cash. We then went up to the office and knocked on the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 466.13px; height: 621.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 466.13px; height: 621.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Waiting outside shortly before phoning Craig, only to discover that he had been in the office all along, but just hadn&#39;t heard our knocking on the door! Gave him a gift of chocolates (as hinted at in the picture) and had a good conversation. We had waited quite a long time in the hallway before going outside to enjoy the sunny weather. Kind people passing by let us </span><span>in to</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the locked restrooms, which was much appreciated. Craig cheerfully validated our parking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>The power was still off when we got back to Kaneohe! Without working traffic </span><span>lights</span><span class="c1">, traffic was at a standstill, and it took us nearly two hours to get to our apartment from the edge of town. There was a package for Sister Krupp in the mailbox, and we texted her but didn&#39;t recommend driving over to get it; they will come tomorrow. We napped, talked, read, played SkipBo and were in bed at 9:30pm (then watched a show for a couple of hours). Another long day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday morning Sara gave Bruce a haircut on the front porch. Then, she worked on getting transcripts sent from BYU Provo to BYU Pathways (at an address also in the BYU admissions department). The sisters came by to get their package. We napped, ate, and talked.</span></p></body></html>
