Before the meeting, Dennis asked Bruce to assist in a blessing for his wife after the meetings; Sara joined in her classroom afterwards and we supported him in his blessing with our faith. Sara also met Keala who had donated the dress she picked up at the relief society activity a couple of weeks ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 489.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 489.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the chapel that evening, Sara dropped Bruce off for choir practice, and he caught a ride home with Elder Chun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday we enjoyed laundry day. Phone call with Ben.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Tuesday, we </span><span>attended district</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;council meeting and afterwards inspected two of the three cars that we need to do before the end of this transfer. And participated in a district photo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 317.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 317.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Elders Cannon, Olson, Tesoro, Hirschi, Crosbie, and Hamblin (leaving for home); Sisters Haycock, Krupp, Pugh, and Sorensen; Conrads Sara and Bruce</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then we treated Sisters Haycock and Krupp to lunch at the food court. This was after listening to Sister Krupp give all of lesson four for practice as a new missionary (which she did in the chapel). She did a great job. Then naps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We were brutally awoken from a sound sleep at 12:30am: the smoke alarm was sounding another false positive. It wouldn&#39;t stop when we pressed the button, so we stuffed it between two pillows in the clothes dryer, and are trying to go back to sleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Wednesday morning, Bruce got up and slipped outside around sunrise, letting Sara sleep; she had had even less sleep. The alarm can still be heard faintly from inside the dryer. Sara got an appointment with Dr. Lawler at 9:30am, so we drove to Honolulu. Bruce dropped her off and went to the mission office to pick up three large print Books of Mormon and a replacement Smoke/CO detector. Then he drove back to pick her up and we dropped off one of the large print Books of Mormon to Denise, leaving it at her apartment door. By this time, we were quite hungry (Sara had gone </span><span>in fasting</span><span class="c1">) so we ate at Safeway across the street and then drove to Waipio Costco and did some shopping. We drove home during a hard rainstorm and Sara has gotten all of the food put away in the freezer and refrigerator.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Thursday was mostly Sara recuperating from her UTI and resting. Bruce went out to return a couple of library books and bought a pizza for lunch. At 5pm we met Sisters Pugh and Sorensen at the Ross store and bought them some new curtain rods; they had thrown the old ones away. Bruce also deactivated the falsely-alarming smoke detector because it just would not stop; that action is not reversible, so he also threw it away. We attended the first session of the ward study group at 6pm. It was interesting to consider the words &quot;therefore&quot; and &quot;nevertheless&quot; in First Nephi, the first verse. After the meeting, Elder Chun assisted Bruce in giving Sara a blessing; then we grabbed a couple of boxes of meals for Daniel and went home. At 9pm we attended the mission zoom call and interacted with our new zone in a breakout room; it looks like Elder Tesoro is a new zone leader (and Elder Crosbie our new district leader), since Elder Fowles &nbsp;&mdash; along with a few others &mdash; left the south district. There are some new people in that district that we will get to know a bit during the next five weeks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday we intended to drive the food to Daniel at his new place in Hawaii Kai, but he ended up driving here (passing out business cards), so we took some food down to him and his son. He had asked for a large print Book of Mormon some time ago, so we were finally able to give him one today. We had a couple of long talks with Helaman, and calls from Eli, Ammon, and Jessica.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday we delivered the last of the large print books to sister missionaries, who were on their way to a lesson with a person who needed one.</span></p></body></html>
