Bruce enjoyed a priesthood lesson on charity while Sara enjoyed a relief society lesson on the same subject. Home for lunch, then back for a meeting with the bishop at 2:30pm (we&#39;ll likely be called as ward family history specialists). While there, an alarmed call from Emily came in, telling us that Eleanor is missing! Police came and helped find her. Sara called Scott Wheeler who was on his way over to help when she was found. We drove to Safeway to get powdered sugar, then came home to mix up a cake, putting it in a Bundt pan and then into the oven. We let it cool for as long as we could, consistent with getting it iced and to the chapel not too long after 7pm. The cake is her contribution to the meal after a funeral tomorrow morning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Monday, we got up early, as Bruce had an assignment to be the security person for early morning seminary. He got up at 4:30am, showered, dressed, and Sara (who had been awake for her own reasons since about two) drove us to the chapel, arriving at 5am. It was so dark that Bruce had trouble seeing the numbers on the lockbox, but with the help of his phone&#39;s flashlight, he got the keys out, and unlocked the gate, and then the outside door. There was a hex wrench on the keyring that allowed him to set up the entryway doors in the unlocked position, so when people arrived they could just come in. Sara went to the other end of the building and sat on the couch doing her sudoku puzzle while Bruce set up a chair near the entrance and waited. The first seminary teacher arrived about 5:15am, followed by a trickle of students, then two other teachers and their students. The first class ended at about 6:15 and the trickling out began. We locked up about 7am and drove home for naps. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We woke up in time to get back to the chapel at 11am, when we helped carry the bento boxes and drinks for the meal after the funeral service that would end soon thereafter. Lots of people were there to celebrate the life of Auli&#39;ilani Kapele who was killed in a traffic accident at age 52. We helped serve, keeping the line going, and then ate ourselves, and helped clean up. Sara&#39;s cake was well-liked. Home again for another nap. We then went out to do some banking but it being indigenous peoples day, we were shut out. Bought some delicious pork belly and came home to eat, clean up the kitchen a bit, and head to bed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Tuesday, Bruce did another shift at 5am for security, and Sara was easily able to open the lockbox. While Bruce sat at the entrance for security, she ended up practicing the organ in the chapel. Bruce found a door that was sort of propped open since yesterday, and reported it to the EQ President by email, attaching this picture. You can see the metal tab at the bottom of the doors (circled in red) that is holding one of them open. </span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 668.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 668.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One of the teachers suggested fixing it with a pair of pliers and he did that, straightening it with a monkey wrench and then hammering it back into place. </span></p><p class="c0"><span>After everyone left, Sara convinced him to sing </span><span class="c3">1009 Gethsemane</span><span>&nbsp;in the chapel in full voice to an absent audience. It was more fun than he expected it would be. On the way home, we stopped and ordered/pre-purchased a dozen donuts at the Leonards truck, then shopped a bit at Safeway (to kill time until the bank opened at 8am), then did some banking. We realized that we had been overcharged for some ribs and stopped by Safeway again to get that sorted out. Only had forty minutes once we got back, and had a nice talk with Helaman, then arrived </span><span>at district</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;council on time, picking up the donuts on the way. They were a hit, a reward for goals achieved. The rest of the meeting was good as well. After that (11:20am), we dropped the milk off at home and drove to Costco to get gas and shop. Now home for lunch and naps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Wednesday we were awake by 5:50am for some unknown reason. We tried a couple of beaches before finding one we liked, and were able to enter the park at 7am. A few minutes in salt water felt really good.Home for breakfast, garbage day, and a brief rest. We drove to Kapolei to meet a great family and had a good visit with them. Since Costco was nearby, we ate lunch there, and a born-again Christian tried to talk us out of our religion. Phone calls to Eli, James, Benjamin, Jessica, and Mike.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Thursday, Bruce has signed up for early morning seminary security again. Sitting at the door, outside one classroom, he overheard the teacher suggest that when reading a scripture we could identify the question or situation that led to the Lord revealing that information; he thought that was a valuable heuristic to use during scripture study. This morning he was careful to greet each student with a cheerful </span><span class="c3">aloha</span><span class="c1">, good morning, and handshake. Afterwards, one of the teachers told him that that greeting had impacted one of the students. Bruce noticed that the picture from the day before yesterday showed him as a partial reflection, so he took a couple of pictures of his ghostly self, and one showing just the mountain near yesterday&#39;s beach spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 565.50px; height: 376.35px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 565.50px; height: 376.35px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span>There is a closer picture of that same mountain &mdash; above and to the north of Kualoa Ranch &mdash; at the end of </span><span class="c5"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/11kKSwbvyVOjcaXCYosZTBlgJMZq4vBv8OGqcQfUeBSE/edit&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1760858752618742&amp;usg=AOvVaw2pBQbyIc1yjbnLyBEOJ-7G">week 10</a></span><span class="c1">, from our first visit to that beach on August 30 at Kualoa Regional Park. Home for naps and a game of SkipBo. In the evening, at 5pm, we drove to the food court to buy the sister missionaries dinner. There we ran into Elder and Sister Brady (stationed on Kauai) who had family visiting and had just been to the PCC. It was a good time with the eight of us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Friday we enjoyed a leisurely morning, preparing for an SYS zoom meeting at 10am. Then we put together a salad and Sara made deviled eggs. We left a little early so that we could make a purchase at Sam&#39;s Club. The freeway was blocked up pretty badly so we drove on surface streets; King Street mainly (at one point we were hit very lightly from behind in traffic, but didn&#39;t bother to stop (there was nowhere to pull off the street) because it didn&#39;t seem like any damage had been done (although Sara&#39;s back began to hurt)). Got there and parked, but they didn&#39;t sell what we needed. We arrived for dinner just at 6pm and had trouble finding the keypad, but a nice security guy came along and helped us by opening the gate. We arrived as Elder Jones was saying the blessing on the food. It was a great selection of soups, breads, and salads.</span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 278.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 278.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Back row of elders: Hollingsworth, Chun, Andersen, Hurd, Conrad, Larsen, Clemons, Jones, Edwards, and Mangum; front row sisters: Hollingsworth, Chun, Bell-Andersen, Hurd, Conrad, Larsen, Mangum, Clemons, Edwards, and Jones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was almost 8pm when we left, so we couldn&#39;t return along the Like Like highway (due to nightly construction), but had to go all the way to the H3.

We put Topricin on Sara&#39;s back and that relieved the pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Saturday, we helped clean the chapel at 7:30am and worked on homework.</span></p></body></html>
