Other meetings ensued, along with naps, and our last night at the MTC.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday, we woke early, packed up, and got our carry-ons and personal items to the front desk. Then we went to breakfast. There we met E&amp;S Price who are going to be in the Area Office in London and had a pleasant conversation over food. We returned to the lobby at five to eight, and met a sister returning to Brazil for some medical care before going to Italy. Rode with Ricky in the shuttle. Caught our flight with plenty of time to spare. After a long flight, we arrived and were met by E&amp;S Lelegren, who gave us beautiful leis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 434.50px; height: 580.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 434.50px; height: 580.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From the airport, they drove us to pick up the Scion (after jump-starting it twice), and followed us to our new apartment. We met E&amp;S Mundell who showed us around before they left for the airport. Sister Lelegren drove their car back to mission headquarters and he drove them to the airport in the van.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tuesday, we went to the district council meeting. Sara dropped Bruce off, and he enjoyed the meeting while she went to O&#39;Reilly&#39;s and bought a battery. Elder Fowles, the district leader, recognized us from March 12, when Sara had seen him and Elder Ames on the street in Waikiki and asked them to come and help Bruce give Helaman a blessing. He and Bruce embraced. Then we drove to mission headquarters for lunch and orientation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wednesday we went shopping at Safeway and purchased a lot of food and a bottle of ammonia for cleaning the apartment. Later in the morning, Sara went swimming with Helaman. The power went out in the smaller bedroom while they were gone, and it ended up being breaker number 2. Helaman bought us barbequed meats. Bruce and Sara attended a 12 step meeting at the Kailua chapel at six p.m. Bruce got the insight that step 4 (taking a personal inventory) is a lot like writing his personal history, which is his current pastime: what things do you reveal and which things do you keep hidden?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thursday was our first SYS (sharpen your scythe) mission-wide video conference and Bruce introduced us very briefly. Senior breakout followed: we are to do a weekly inspection of missionary cars for basic cleanliness and keep their keys if it fails; they&#39;d then be on foot all day. Learned that our zone will go to the temple in Laie next Tuesday at 9 a.m., so the district council will be on Monday next week. Drove to Honolulu to meet with Craig Nagamine. Drove back to meet E&amp;S Peterson and get instruction on the inspection of two apartments and two cars just before transfer day a week from today. Met Helaman at Golden Pho for dinner and had a bit of trouble turning our car around after missing the driveway, and he helped us out of that predicament. Good food was enjoyed by all.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Friday (July 4) Bruce took a couple of pictures of the mountains west of our apartment building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 297.19px; height: 396.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 297.19px; height: 396.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 297.50px; height: 397.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 297.50px; height: 397.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Left from our deck, and right from the other side of the building. Shopping at Lowes and Ross in Honolulu, then drove to a house to buy some rugs. We were late then had to wait half an hour in the sun. Back home to lunch and a long nap. Went to the sisters&#39; apartment at 6:30pm to inspect it and their car, which took over an hour. Nice evening conversation with Helaman. We learned on Facebook that Jim and Melinda Moore and family are on Oahu, responded to their post, and they phoned us and we talked for quite some time. We&#39;ll be getting together sometime in the next couple of days. For the first time, we stayed awake until after 10pm, an important step in getting used to our new time zone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Saturday we awoke early, and were busy with laundry and continuing to sort through all of the stuff left behind in the apartment by previous tenants. Finally, we are all moved in, with quite a few boxes of stuff to get rid of somehow. After the Moore family got through with their Jurassic Adventure ten miles north of us, they stopped at our place and rearranged the seats in their SUV so they could take us to a place to &quot;eat by the water&quot; as Jim had requested, He&rsquo;eia Pier General Store &amp; Deli, which was quite close. We then repaired to our apartment, where Sara crafted an eye patch for Jacob who seemed to be suffering from conjunctivitis in his left eye.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Below, Melinda and Bruce share a laugh, their family portrait, and some candids.</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 296.04px; height: 409.91px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.png" style="width: 296.04px; height: 409.91px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 254.17px; height: 408.09px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 254.17px; height: 408.09px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 290.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 290.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They left to drive to hike Manoa Falls, and we got ready for Sunday and retired for the night.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
